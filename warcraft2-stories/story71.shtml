I was sitting in kchat. I had just gotten back from my stupid camping
trip. When there is some geek named Kobhushi something challenging me.
He does the usual. Shlonglor's too scared to play me crap. So I agreed.
I agreed to one way in only, because I had just been practicing it and
I had some new tricks I wanted to try. After all, One Way in is the cheat map.
If you are stupid enough to play it, you deserve to lose.<P>

Anyway, the guy was being a dick, saying I want to see how good your are
blah blah. I forgot exactly what he said. He agreed to my map and resource
so we played. I got top left, he got bottom. Soooo.<P>

I started off. I did the building order for what I wanted to do. I got together
about 7-8 grunts and went right. I was in the pass when I saw 2 footmen coming
from top right going left to my town. My guys were already 1/2 down the pass. I
pulled one grunt off, told him to attack, I split the rest of my forces in 2. I
sent half to bottom left, and the other half to top right. I figured he pulled
that ancient build your barracks by their town crap. I figured that I would
go down bottom left and fine his peons all ready to be raped. Instead, there
was nothing there! WTF? I headed over right but my guys going top right
found he had a walled in town top right. Gee, that's a gay place to build.<P>

The 2 footemn I sent after his 2 footmen weren't as successful as I had hoped.
He had 1 footmen in my peons killing them. I gathered my peons and raped his
ass. That footmen only had 10 or so hit points. I finished off his grunts
at his town. He had a walled in town, smith, a tower, and a barracks. I quickly
setup the 2+ on 1 on his barracks. I also started attacking the farm.<P>

He kept pumping grunts but I was able to take them quite easily with the 
whatever on 1 setup. But he had a tower on the inside. Around the time I got
that farm and barracks, his tower went up to cannon tower. I started beating
on his buildings and smith to get in his wallin. He had 3+ peons reparing
from the other side. Notice this Picture:<P>

Gotcha and Warp were both sitting there laughing. This went on for
quite a while. Didn't bother me any. I could pop all the footmen I wanted
for hours while he couldn't get ahead at all using all that lumber to repair.
Eventually, (Gotcha guesses) he ran out of lumber and this happened:<P>

hahahahahah. Now that was funny.<P>

He said nice game, and was pretty nice through the whole game. Nothing
like Vertigo 0-4 guy. What an easy and entertaining game. But check
out the crap he posted on the case's page following...

The following was taken from a post on Cases' Ladder Web Board. It
was made by Kobushiskhi<P>

sorry guys<P>

Today I caught Shlonglor on at Hyperspeed, and I wanted to see how good 
this "legend" was. Anyway, after finally convincing him to play, he agreed
as long as it was one way in on low. Anyway, I just wanted to see how good 
he was, so I agreed.<P>

I figured that he would do the tommyng, or some variant of it, so I did my
counter. Unfortunately, he didn't do the tommyng, instead he did a 
straight grunt rush. Anyway, it was an interesting game but I lost.
<P>
What I'm wondering now is... Is he a tactical genius and knew what i was 
going to do, thus avoiding the tommyng? Or does he not know about the 
tommyng at all? Bottom line is: He is good, but nowhere near as good as 
he thinks he is. I'm pretty sure that most of the top20 could beat him, 
just not me =).
<P>
Kobushi the loser
