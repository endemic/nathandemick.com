Normally I don't put up stories ragging on people. BUT Tower is an
exception. He pulls all this low stuff to win games. It seems he needs
his tricks to win.<p>

Here is a story by Cadaver:<p>

        Ok so I was just smurfing around like usual...playing under the name
Raisin Bran this time.  This guy named Tower$$ comes on and starts talking
about "Where's Cadaver?  That guy sucks!" so I say "hmm so you can beat him
right?"  Well, I knew I could slime the crap off tower, so I just play
along, and wait for him to come out and challenge me.  There is some
background to this however.  Me and someone else were playing a game on
Garden of Gold vs Tower$$ and someone else.  Anyways he did the build lumber
mill and nothing else strategy and managed to kill me off.  Whoo ha...anyone
can do it.  It's cheap, and we all know it.  No one does that in a real
game.  So I says to Tower..."That's cheap and I'm going to restart."  So I
did, and he doesn't do it again, and I think we won, but I don't remember.
So after that, I branded Tower a cheap ass who I wasn't going to play
anymore.  Also, he told me that doing that stupid trick is a big part of his
game.  What kind of loser relies on that crap to win games?  I realized that
I was in the company of a serious idiot here.<p>

        So anyways me and Shlonglor and about all the other good war2
players were on Castle, and then Tower$$ shows up and starts talking bad
about me.  I was just waiting for him to challenge me, and he finally did.
I said...let's go bitch!  Shlonglor and Vermeer both tell me to watch
talking bad unless I knew I could win...so I kept talking bad about him,
calling him a bad words and everything else I could think of.  And after some
delay....we finally started.  I served, and he said pick anything I want, so
I picked Plains of Grunts on low.  I was green, and Tower$$ was orange.  I
figured since I had a clear line of attack, he was screwed.  The game starts
and I do my normal buildup, and walked into his base with about 7 grunts
after a few minutes.  He didn't have anything...I think like 1 footman.
But, true to his name, he had about 4 towers.  Luckily, he had left some
peons outside, so I killed em.  Also, I killed his blacksmith, but I got
some grunts killed doing it.  At this point, I knew I had him beat.  His
mine was about to run out, and I had the exit guarded with grunts.  So, I
knew he was screwed.<p>

I started laughing and upgraded to stronghold, intent
on opening a chain of taco bells.  I just kept upgrading, and sent my peons
down to yellow's mine to get a new town.  However, they started dying as
they went in....he had a town there, with towers and everything!  I was
shocked, how did he get by me?  Oh well...I just went to blue's and started
there.  I opened five taco bells, and started making tacos.  His farms and
towers fit pretty good inside those tacos, and I just kept making them.  I
didn't even bother to kill most of his guys, I just liked wasting his
buildings.  I had about 15 or so ogres guarding my bases, and he didn't have
any more barracks, so I figured I won.  So since he had been such a dickhead
to me, I decided to just taco everything, and only use my ogres if he
attacked me.  I just kept blowing shit up, and he just kept rebuilding it.  I
never let him have another mine, and I had all the others by this time, so I
just upgraded everything I could and got out some Death Knights.  I did some
death and decay on a group of about 6 towers he had guarding his base at
yellow...there were too many to sapper them.  But, the decay part of death
and decay worked nicely.  Anyways, he kept rebuilding towers everywhere, and
I kept killing them....<p>

It was getting boring, so I tried to get him to give
up, but he wouldn't, so I built like 15 zepplins and went looking.  I found
all his guys and murdered them.

at this screenshot, this is his
last tower right before I kill it.  then the game was over, and he was
saying crap like "It hurts to say it, but you are pretty good.  I bet I can
beat you on water though."  Yeah right.  The day I lose to you Tower$$, if
you're reading this, will be the day I give you my computer.  You will never
beat me in your whole entire life, at anything.  For those of you who don't
believe me, take a look at the stats.  Hahahaha. Tower SUCKS!! Hahahaa.

Shlonglor: I call this story <b>1 farm.</b><p>

Hearing about those games makes me remember my first and only game
with Tower. It was an IWL game. I challenged him. He picked Nowhere to
run. It was close for a while but I made like a ton of Catapults. I also
had a bunch of like level 4 Grunts. Well to cut the story short I gained
control of 3 of the corners. I went in on him and I found out he only
had <b>ONE</b> Farm! He had upgraded to Keep,
had blacksmith and an inventor. But what good is all that with only <b>ONE</b>
farm? He built some demo teams, but I would just kill them with grunts.
What could you even hope to do with 1 or 2 sappers on Nowhere to run
anyway. Well I always wondered what kind of idiot would only build 
1 farm. After hearing all these other stories about tower, I finally
figured out why.<br><b>Tower just sucks.</b><p>
