It was a rematch on Whatkey after our big win on Whatkey (Andrews boys 6-0).
This time it was Andrews boys (Gotcha, Shlonglor, Warp) & Silver Vs
Shaf, Maddawg, Lrdschroeder and Wermacht. They traded LrdSchroeder
for Stormshadow, otherwise it was an exact rematch.<P>

This time, Gotcha was below me bottom left of th map. I was above him.
That meant that we only had one side to watch. Warp and Silver were on the
right side of the screen with Maddawg between them. Lrd Shroeder was top
left above me and Left of Warp. Wermacht was right of Gotcha and Left
of Shaf.<P>


We grouped our guys together in the middle. But instead of hunting the 
other 4 down and killing them, we decided to put our guys on patrol. We
all hit patrol and for some reason, this following picture shows
the interesting pattern that resulted :)<P>

Everyone planed on going land this time. There was no reason to go sea, and it would have been very dangerous. Since Maddawg was between Warp and Silverwolf,
the obvious strategy was to double team him.<P>

Well Gotcha went farm farm farm barracks. He ran in on Wermacht. Werm had
a smith, mill, barracks and 1 grunt. Gotcha went in with 4 grunts and that was
the end of Werm. Werm was saying all this stuff about brilliant plan blah blah.
There is some new rush going around where you get like 4 grunts in like 3 minutes. Werm thought Gotcha pulled that but all Gotcha did was go farm farm farm barracks.<P>

Silver and Warp double teammed Maddawg. I looked over on his screen and
all I see is a ton of Grunts killing Madddawg's peons hahaha. He was out.
That left Lrd and Shaf.<P>

I went farm farm farm barracks. I got out 3 grunts. I set up a 2on1 in
the passage leading into my town. I then made a couple of Axers and a Cat.
If whoever was up top (Lrd) happen to try to rush me on land, he would had
to fight 1 Grunt vs 2 grunts, 2 axers and a cat. hahah. Once I knew
there was no way I could be taken on land, I built a shipyard. I got a Jugg out when I saw Lrd had a transport heading for middle. I told Gotcha. I guess Gotchaalready had some towers in the middle or shortly later got got some. He took care of Lrd's little attempt to take middle.<P>

After that it was a one on one fight between Lrd and I on sea. Lrd and I have
gone one on one at sea plenty of other times (me winning all of them) :)
I got up a 2nd shipyard with 2-3 peons repairing it. I went up to level 2-3
Juggs. After a pretty good Jugg battle. I finally overcame Lrd. I pumped out more Juggs then he did and overcame him with both level and numbers. And killing
his oil rig sure helped too :) After that LRd was off the sea.<P>

I then sent over a little raiding party. I saw Lrd had a tower. I'm sure
he didn't know I could reach it with a cat in the passages between us.

<b>Check out me killing his tower.</b></a><P>

After that, I sent in a sapper and got some of his stuff. Silverwolf helped me
and we killed Lrd.

<b>Take a look at our little raiding party :)</b></a><P>

This was shortly followed by Bloodlusted Ogres and a Death Knight. We
then finished off Lrd. He was killing his own stuff. Probably in frustration :)
<P>

We then noticed Shaf (Mister Sneaky man) was set up at Maddawgs old town.
He had a bunch of towers, some troops, a barracks, and was mining away.
He also had a Mage tower. We 3 person invaded his place. Gotcha Maged
the whole place. I sent in the lusted Ogres, and Lusted up Gotcha's Knights.
Man, that was fun :)<P>

Just look at that those stats. Man, I would cry if that were me :)
That has to be the biggest ass kicking ever. I mean those 4 are
the top Water players of Kali too :)<P>

At least Lrd and Maddawg got their revenge in a later game :)<P>
