After about 4 IWL games, Searon~~ and Pokerto$$ decided to challenge
Gotcha and I(Shlonglor) to an IWL game. I of course picked The Spiral.
As everyone knows, the Spiral is my favorite level. I spent the entire
month of December playing on it everyday.<p>

Gotcha was Blue. I was Purple, Pokerto was orange and Searon was Aqua.
We picked medium resources of course. We started out. We kept noticing 
Pokerto was talking to someone. His messages kept appearing on the
screen. Then we figured it out. Pokerto had forgotten to turn off his
messages!!!! Gotcha and I were saying if he doesn't turn them off, this
game was going to be so much fun. Well he didn't figure it out.
Muhahahaha. Gotcha and I were building. Pokerto types something like
"Let's get Shlonglor. I want him". some crap like that. Gotcha and I were
laughing so hard. I say to Gotcha "come get me man I'll be ready,
hahaha." So Gotcha and I put up our shipyard about the same time. 
Since I was sandwhiched between Pokerto and Searon, I decided my only
hope was to snag the oil in the middle of the map. So I built my
shipyard and foundry by the inner mine.
We had
ours just about completed our shipyards 
when Pokerto types, "putting up my shipyard."
hahahhaha. I go to Gotcha "That's too bad because ours our done. haha"
<p>
So Gotcha and I whipped out a Jugg a piece. I guess Searon and Pokerto
had also. I made another Shipyard on Pokerto's side of the Island. Just
then Pokerto types "let's get our ships together and take out
Shlonglor." Gotcha and I already had our ships together and I go "let's
take them out before they can get together, haha" So we both headed to
Searon and got rid of his Jugg. We then headed back and got Pokerto's 
Battleship. I think it was about then when Pokerto started getting mad.
He typed to Searon "these fuckers" and stuff like that.<p>

I think we owned
the sea after that. We took out Searon's crap. Then Pokerto goes
something like "I'm going to invade Shlonglor." I had maybe 2 grunts at
the time. So I started making more and made a second barracks. I was
flying over Red's place and I see a transport unload some Footman on it.
Then Pokerto goes in. But then he types "I landed on the wrong island!"
I was laughing so hard. It seems the dumb ass doesn't have a clue where
Purple is on Spiral. So he got in the transport and invaded me. He
really still had more guys then me. I got screwed. I kept pumping out
the Ogres. He killed a ton of my peons and halted my building. I finally
killed off his guys. Pokerto types "Shlonglor is Dead." I go to Gotcha,
"that is what he thinks." Muhahahahhaha. So I got my guys rolling again.
Pokerto flys over again and goes something like "oh Shlonglor is alive
again." hahahaahah.<p>

So Pokerto decided to get Greedy and snag Red's
island. Gotcha and I caught him as he was building his hall. Sometime
around then, Searon Death and Decayed my Foundry and got rid of it. So
what, I didn't need it anyway. The ship stage was long over. I had some
Juggs and transports. I think it was around that time that Gotcha sank
Pokerto's transport. He types to Searon "shit!" Gotcha and I knew
exactly what he was talking about, hahahaha.<P>

So I loaded up a load of Ogres and go in on
Pokerto, and it seems Gotcha had the same Idea. We both invaded at the
same time. I didn't even tell him to. What a great partner. So we go in
and waste Pokerto's new town. So Pokerto goes "These fuckers are double
teaming me. See they won't play me one on one. They need to double team
me to beat me." Hahahahahha We were laughing so hard. Gotcha had refused
Pokerto's one on one challenge earlier because like me, he doesn't seem
to like 1 on 1s either. 
So we took out Pokerto's new town.<p> 

I then invaded
Pokerto's main island. I killed some crap but got kicked off. So He
builds a town hall near the inner mine on his island. So I start hitting
it with Juggs. He was so mad. He made a catapult. I invaded him when he
was about to hit my Juggs with it. He was so pissed. hahahaha. He goes
to Searon "That's it, I'm outta here." So I turn on my messages to
Pokerto and and say "No don't leave yet." It was then that he realized
what an idiot he was, hahahaha. I go "it seems you left your messages
on." Muhahahahhaah. I go "nice to know you think we are both fuckers."
He goes "just terms of endearment." <p>

I really don't know what Gotcha did the whole game. I think he was
working on Searon. He took care of Searon so that is all that matters.
He said he blizzarded Searon's peons, hahahah.
So they both gave it up.<p>

That was one of the funniest games I've ever played. It is so cool to
hear what people say about you behind your back.<p>

at the stats.<p>                                                  

Moral: If you are going to cuss people out, cry like a baby, and be
down right nasty, you better make sure your messages are set right :)

Muhahahhaha (thanks to Tou and Chrism for that cool laugh.)<p>
