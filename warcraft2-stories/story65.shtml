We got together another group willing to take on the Andrews boys.
We picked up Silverwolf for the second time and went Gotcha, Shlonglor,
Warp, Silverwolf vs LrdShroeder, FlankerX, Wermacht, & Isildur.<P>

We had never tried Muzzy's Rivers 2, and I really wanted to try it out. I
love water and I was kinda getting sick of FOC... So we all got the pud
and started off.<P>

What is different about this pud is it is ALL sea. Foc is mostly sea, but
you can survive without it. You don't even need a shipyard to win on HSC :)
But on Rivers 2, it's win the sea or DIE.<P>

I got top Right. Gotcha was below me, Warp was below him, and Flanker
at the bottom right. LrdSchroeder was Top left, Werm next, Isildur below
him.<P>

I was humans of course, Gotcha and Silver were human and Warp orc. The
rest of them were all human too I believe. Warp is like the only one,
besides Nate that still goes Orc on Sea :)<P>

This had to be one of the coolest naval battle games I've ever played. I got
up 2 shipyards and started pumping Juggs like crazy. Warp couldn't find his oil. I had 3 tankers and a rig done before he finally found his. He took some
oil spot a screen or so away from his island. haha. I sent all my first few
Juggs down to FlankerX. Warp and Silver sent some too. We got into some Jugg
fights and didn't do so great. So I said send all the Juggs to above
warp's Island. Silver sent his Jugg. Warp sent 1 or 2. Gotcha sent 2. I
waited until I had 6 level 3 Juggs. During this time, they were beating
the heck out of Silverwolf. He was off the sea because the enemy fleet
was all over him. Werm invaded Silver with 6 Grunts. He kept sending over 
Grunts and then Lrd got his tower. That left him dead :)<P>

We went left, over to Silver's with all our Juggs and
utterly destroyed the enemy fleet. Lrd came down with a second wave (He is one of the best Jugg pumpers out their) I took out that wave too. During this
time Gotcha invaded FlankerX and killed ALL his peons. Flanker was able to
get 4 or so towers up and saved his town barely :) Someone started attacking us
with Subs. Warp got the flier out and using attack ground and Warp's flyer
we beat off the subs.<P>

I then took the island left of me. Set the hall up right on the sea. I
sent 4 or so Grunts over to protect it and threw up a tower. haha. I
then took some more peons and set up a mill on the island below that one and
started chopping. Once the wood started rolling in, I went level 4 and 5 Juggs.
My rig blew and I noticed they were looking for oil too. I sent down my Juggs
to attack FlankerX. While I was down there, Warp got attacked. By the time I
got up there with my Juggs I didn't see much. I went over to Silverwolf's
Island and Took out 3-4 of Lrd's Juggs. He was TRYING to get oil at Silver's place but I quickly put an end to that. 
Flanker started attacking Warp. I sent down my Juggs and bailed them out.
Man I forgot how powerful level 5 Juggs are. About 4 of my ships that
game survived 2 hits and had like 10 hit points a piece or so.
<P>
I got up to Keep and got a Inventor
and Stables. During this time I sent down My Juggs and got Isildur's shipyard
and foundry. Warp set up camp on Silver's old Island. Silver was out of the game
at this time. Lrd got his only peon that survived the first attack. Gotcha
took out Isildur and I believe FlankersX second island. Gotcha then
set up on it and another island. At this time I had a fleet of 4
or so Subs, about 8 or more level 5 Juggs.<P>

Isildur surrendered. I'm not sure exactly what happened to him. Gotcha
got his 2nd and I think he might have got invaded at his main. Werm Surrendered too. That left Flanker and Lrd. Lrd and Flanker were both pretty much stuff on their islands. FlankerX had a transport, but I had server ships locked on it.<P>

I went castle and Mages. But I had the damn unit limit most the game. That
game was glittering prizes for me pretty much. The only thing that was
ever stopping me was having too much stuff. Gotcha invaded Flanker and
took him down. He got off a few peons and landed on a little island with
nothing on it. I used a Jugg to pick him off. Elimination, muhahaha.<P>

Lrd had quite a nice camp going. He had lots of towers. He had flyers.
He had a bunch of mages with slow and more. I sent in a sapper, and he
slowed it and beat the heck out of it with Mages. It was pretty
funny. We wondered where Lrd was getting all that money. We found he
had a little island left of his main. Warp got it with Lusted Ogres and
I invaded just a little too late to enjoy in the fun. I kept trying to
make Gryphons but I had the stupid unit limit. I had Warp kill 4 of my
footman and I killed some peons to make some Mages and a Gryphon. At
this time I had 10 or more Mages with everything but flame shield and Poly.
<P>

Warp invaded Lrd with Ogres. Lrd slowed them all and beat the heck out of
them with towers and everything. It was really funny. I decided to
pull some cool tricks. Lrd kept Blizzarding everyone's ships and flyers,
so while he was doing this, I did this to him:<P>

I planted an Invisible Gryphon over his mages in the midst of his towers
and everything. Look at his Mage casting Blizzards on the ships totally
unaware. I then popped out of invis and attacked the Mage. The old man ran
around the corner and I think Gotcha killed him. hahaha. The towers
took my Gryphon but who cares. The laugh value was worth it. I then
Blizzard Lrd's towers on one side. I got in the transport thinking there
might be more left. But Gotcha had landed on the other side of
the Island with 6 Mages.<P> 

Silverwolf was concerned the game wasn't being Documented properly :)<P>

Gotcha then Launched a MEGA blzzard on Lrd's castle killing it
pretty damn quick, faster than I could hit screen shot :) Warp ran
in with his Lusters.<P>

My mages finally made it over. Lrd's town was gone in a minute or
less. But they made it for the group picture at least :)<P>

Check out Gotcha and I. Even. We are like twins. Warp was a bit behind
us :) Silverwolf, got killed but who needs Silverwolf when you got
the Andrews boys. This was a great game. I don't think the other
side did that bad. It was a great battle.<P>
