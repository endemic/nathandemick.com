This story happened a long time ago but I still remember most of it. Stormshadow,
Gotcha and I were all in kchat. Storm, who never seems to like kchat got us to play
a game. We served and our plan was me, Gotcha, and Storm vs however many we could
get. I wanted FOC cause everyone knows I love Water. Well we were in Warchat and
Lazlo, Psycho, Lord Archer and Peace Dude showed up. We told them the teams... Shlonglor,
Gotcha, Stormshadow vs ALL. We started the game.<p>

I was in aqua. Gotcha in Black, and I think Storm was Purple. Lazlo was Red, Psycho Orange,
Lord Archer White, and Peace Dude was in Yellow. For those lammers that don't
know the colors, go read my map pages :)<p>

As soon as the game started, Peace dude started saying he didn't want to team with anyone.
He said he wanted to be on his own team. Lord Archer started saying stuff to Peace Dude.
It turned into a big fight that was damn funny. Lord Archer said he was going to take Peace
Dude down and Peace dude was saying stuff like come on and try it.<p>

Storm, Gotcha and I were really laughing. We had the game already won if those idiots
couldn't even fight on the same side. I believe we clearly stated that me, Storm and Gotcha
were on the same side but I guess they didn't care. haha. Winning the game? What's that?
 Well the game began. I got out the Juggs and started beating on Psycho, I got rid of his 
shipyard and stuff. I took a couple of peons with my Juggs. The guy quit! That was all 
it took to get rid of him. hahaha. "Gee a few of peons were hit. BYE" :)<p>

I attacked Laszlo and Lord Archer with my Juggs. Later we got flyers and discovered
that Peace dude had no ships at all. He had turned his island into one massive tower town
and he also had Mages. Lots of Mages. This was pretty early in the game too.
<p>

Gotcha and I were thinking how does this idiot expect to win? Well I took down Lord Archer's
Shipyard and stuff and went around the bottom of his island (white). I started to hit his
good buildings like Alchemists. But he had some catapults. My Juggs were killed by the cats. 
I made some more and went up and worked on Lazlo. I discovered that he didn't have anything 
on land. I invaded him and took out all resistance. I had a few grunts beating on his stuff. This was
before I knew about patrol so I would tell my guys to attack a building, it would be destroyed,
and way later, I would notice they were done and I would start on another building. I think I
only had like 3 or so grunts so it was a long process.<p>

Well Storm got another island, Blue. I ran up there and put up a hall too. We both started
mining it. We had a mining fight during that time. I would block all his peons out then
he would block mine out. It was funny.<p>

During this time, I guess Gotcha was using Mages to try to attack Peace Dude.
Before that tho', Lord Archer loads up a transport full of Sappers. He lands on Peace Dude's
island. Peace Dude slowed the sappers and blizzarded them all. It was so funny. After that
Peace dude was like, "Is that all you can do? You suck." Stuff like that. 
That got Archer mad. I think he tried a few more attacks. But, I invaded Archer and took 
out a lot of his stuff and pretty much took him out of the game.<p>

I think it was around then Gotcha started trying to get Peace Dude with invisible transports,
Polymorph and the lot. I think he had one attack that failed miserably. Peace Dude starts 
yelling stuff like "Gotcha you suck. You didn't do anything to me." I was really hating this guy 
bad. I guess Storm tried invading with DKs and made an even worse invasion. Peace Dude really 
started ragging on Storm when it failed. I got mad and started ragging on Peace Dude. I'm like you 
idiot, you think you can win this way? He was like, I don't see you attacking me Shlonglor. I said 
you will see me invading you soon.<p>

At this point Lord Archer was just sitting on his island. I'm not sure if he had flyers or not.
It was me, Storm, and Gotcha trying to invade Peace Dude. This was about 1 or more hours
into the game.<p>

During this whole time, I had those 3 or so grunts gradually, I mean really slowing, destroying
Laszlo's town. Gotcha, Storm and I kept invading Peace dude. I would go in, loose some 
crap but I would get a mage or something. Gotcha kept track of the Mages with flyers. Money was
so low and I only had a few flyers. After a while, he killed all my flyers and I had to
use <b>the force</b> to know where to attack ;)
We gradually killed Mage after Mage. Eventually we got it
down to about 1 or 2 Mages. We used his inability to control everything at once to finally surprize
the Mage and kill it. Then we landed and started wasting his town and towers.<p>

What was so amazing was it took all 3 of us down to our last guys to pull this off.
I guess it's not really that amazing since he spent no money on ships and didn't attack
anyone and just sat around making Mages and towers. If someone is allowed to do that,
of course they are going to be strong.<p>

He started saying a lot of crap at the end. He didn't like us using hit and run strategies.
He also didn't enjoy the fact that we were not dumb enough to charge all his towers
and Mages with Ogres. DUH. Who would do that?
I think it was then he started talking about kills. How he had them all or something.
I think that was his goal in the game. Most kills.
<p>

Another thing
that this was about 2-3 hours into the game when we finally got him. You know what Laszlo
was doing all this time? Nothing. He was sitting there for over two hours just watching
his farms, and few buildings as I was killing them. He didn't talk or anything till the end.
He didn't ever get flyers and his view was limited to his island.
I was thinking man what kinda guy would sit there waiting 2 hours for someone to kill him?
He was then like "good game, do you wanna finish all my stuff?" 
I don't know if he was talking to the other players during this time or what he was doing. 
That's either real determination or stupidity :)<P>

Lord Archer was still alive. He was quite happy that we killed Peace Dude. Storm,
Gotcha and I invaded him and wasted the place.<P>

StormShadow introduced a new strategy in the game. The peaceful mining village strategy. 
If you look at the stats, Storm had more money than me or Gotcha but at the end of the
game he had nothing but peons and a few troops. I invaded and kill Pyscho, Laszlo, Peace
Dude, and Lord Archer. Gotcha used and got his kills offa Peace dude and they were real
kills such as Mages. What did storm do? Now I'm not ragging on his playing ability or him.
Storm was practicing the Peaceful mining strategy. Take all the gold and lumber, make
a million peons and spend it on nothing :) I think what Storm did was make a million
peons and built a ton of farms because he had a whole island full and I mean full of peons
at the end. I guess that's ok since we won. <p>

Well on to the point of the story. What the hell is up with Peace Dude? What kinda idiot
builds no ships and sits there waiting for others to attack? There is no way in a million
years he could have won. He didn't even build transports. We could have killed everyone,
got all 7 mines, made 1000 Mages and he would not have been able to do nothing to stop
it. Was it because he was trying to prove he could take on everyone? Well of course he
could on a map like that with not that much gold and since we spent a lot of our money
beating other players. So duh, of course he is going to be able to take on a lot of
players. So if that is what he was trying to prove, no duh. Course he can take on 3 by
sitting on his ass and defending.
Well I think his plan was to prove that he can get more kills than anyone using this
strategy.<p>

Well Peace Dude,
<a href="PICS/pdude.jpg"><font size=+1>Check out the Stats.</font></a><p>

<b>Who got the most Kills? Muhahahahahhahahahhahahah</b><p>

I wish I could see Peace Dude sometime to rub this in his face. I guess telling all of you
is enough :)<p>

The End.
