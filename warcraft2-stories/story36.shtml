I tried to do a new strategy this game which ended up costing me.  
I upgraded to a stronghold when I had about 8 peons.  I did get ogres fairly 
quick but Xar-$$ did the same thing.  The thing that he did differently was 
that he didn't make a Mill or as many peons as I did.  Sort of like the 
7 man Ogre rush in medium resource games.  Anyways I beat off his first 
wave, but his second wave finished my base off.  I was able to get about 
5 peons out of the base though.  I had about 2500-3000 gold and about 
1600 wood left.  I built a mine at yellow's spot and sealed off my hall. 
When Xar was mopping up the buildings at my base he asked me if I would give 
up, I said no.  I had about 15-18 peons chopping and hauling gold at my 
second town with a cannon tower when he found it.  So he asked me again if 
I would give up, and I said no.  During this whole time I had a peon on 
the outside that was secretly rebuilding another base just north of the 
woods of my original base at red.  I made sure to keep it away from any
gold mines so that it would lessen the chance of it being discovered.  
Anyways I knew what was going to happen, Xar-$$ started building demo 
teams to blow through to my mine.  The first team came and blew up my 
blocking farm so I immediately built another, hahaha.  By this time I had 
another barracks, some farms, and a smith at my 2nd town which he had not 
discovered.  Fact during this whole time I'm positive that he thought the 
only thing I had was that mine.  So quite some time passes and I upgrade 
to a stronghold and start making an ogre mound.  By this time I had two 
barracks but hadn't made any grunts, since grunts are next to worthless 
to lvl 5 knights.<p>  

All of a sudden he sent in 4 demo teams and destroyed my stronghold.  
So upon seeing that I immediately built another townhall so he couldn't 
invade!  hahaha.  I already had the ogre mound built so I didn't really 
need the stronghold anymore except for the gold bonus.  My hall cost me 
1200 gold, 800 wood, his 4 sappers cost 2800 gold, 1000 wood. hahaha.  
<p>

Then I started training lvl 5 ogres.  I had about 15 of them when I decided 
to bust a move.  I wasn't sure how many knights Xar had but I had a 
feeling he wasn't training them since he thought the only thing I had was 
that single mine.  So I sent 9 ogres to black's mine and sure enough I 
found his second mine completely undefended.  I killed all his peons there 
and his mine.  At this point he finally broke through with knights and 
multiple demo teams and took my 2nd mine down.  If I could have held it 
would have been over for him right there, since I had more troops than he 
did and I had destroyed his gold supply.  I sent the rest of my ogres to 
attack his town in hopes of killing his knights with superior numbers as 
they were being trained.  I slowly lost that battle though since he had 
much more gold than I did even though I had more beginning troops.  
Anyways I had one peon left and 2000 gold, and 3000 wood.  I sent that peon 
to orange's mine and set camp again with a hall and farms and a cannon 
tower.  Oh yeah, when he wiped out my mine and finished off my ogre 
offensive he asked me if I would give up again, I said no :)  
<p>
Mean while I started training more peons at my 3rd mine while he was 
destroying my barracks, ogre mound, smith and mill AGAIN.  I had managed to 
train a few grunts after my mound was destroyed and stashed them away. 
When he found my 3rd mine he asked me if I would give up, I said no.  
With the few grunts that I had, I checked all the possible mines to see if 
he was mining again, he wasn't.  I figured that he was using up his stored 
gold, but knew that he had to be getting low since he had a castle and a mage 
tower.  Then all of a sudden a mage casts blizzard on my 3rd mine destroying 
my cannon tower and half my peons hauling gold.  I immediately sent a grunt 
to attack the mage.  He had about 5-8 knights there but the grunt was able 
to kill the mage in time before he was killed.  Good thing too, since there 
would have been nothing I could have done against a mage.  Anyways the 
knights started to beat on my town with my cannon tower gone, I put peons on 
repair mode and was just able to hold the knights off long enough until I 
got another cannon tower up.  I don't know why but for some reason his 
knights kept attacking after my cannon tower came on line.  Maybe it was a 
desperate attempt to break through or he forgot I don't know.  My tower killed 
at least 7 knights that were attacking.  I held the mine and the gold was 
rolling in again.  During this whole time I have been secretly rebuilding a 
3rd town, Muhahaha!! :)  I had checked all the mines again and saw that he 
still didn't have another mine.  I knew he didnt have many peons left 
because I had killed all his gold miners earlier and quite a few of his 
wood choppers in my Ogre offensive.<p>  

So... it was at this point that Xar said that he had to go.  Hmmmm.  
I don't think he had enough gold for another hall or to even make peons 
to haul more gold with.  I'm sure he must have had some peons but not 
many.  I don't know for sure but basically I think that he had no income, 
few peons, and not enough gold for another hall.  After all, if he had 
more gold wouldn't he have trained another mage to blizzard my hall?  He had 
more knights than I had grunts and I could't have stopped him.  It would have 
taken him forever to get enough gold to build another hall if he only had 
2-3 peons.  I didn't see any peons anywhere when I scouted the board.  
I had tons of gold and wood coming in with no way for him to stop it.  
Plus I was starting to crank out the grunts (I figured they would be worth 
it since he only had 5-6 knights left). So I think rather than admitting 
defeat after having me on the run the whole game and destroying two complete 
towns he said that he had to go.  Lame.  But the game was fun :)  Never, 
Never, Never give up.  I refuse to lose. If i'm down you better keep 
beating on me to make sure I stay dead :)<p>
