You ever have one of those games where no matter what the enemy tried
you had out thought them. You predict their every single move and out think
and out play it. Well those kinda games don't happen too often but when
they do, man they sure make you feel cool about yourself :)<P>

It was me, Maddawg, Vermeer, vs Doomgaze, Wermacht and Beowulf on FOC.
I was Red, Werm Black, Maddawg Orange, Vermeer Yellow, Beo was White,
and Doomgaze blue.<P>

Vermeer was doing his Normandy Invasion order. He landded on Beo and
he was gone. I did an early scout with my tanker and found Werm was
black. Werm only usually does one thing on sea, Rush. So I decided
to do what I never had the courage to do before, Destroyer rush :)<P>

I pumped a destroyer and got to his yard and saw nothing was out yet. So
I pulled back and waited for his transport.<P>

Hahah tranport pops out and my destroyer moves in. As you can see I was early,
Maddawg wasn't even starting pumping his Juggs yet :)
<br clear=left><P>

I put the Destroyer on lock and Werm started running across the whole
map with the Destroyer on it's tail.<P>

I pumped a second Destroyer and put it on the next trans to pop out hahaha.
I then pumped my first Jugg. I made sure that he didn't get anyone
off the island.<P>

I went around to the other side of the island and saw Werm was trying
to make another yard. I also saw his 6 grunts that he had planned on
invading with hahaha. 6 mens without a boat. My Jugg nailed a bunch of
them there. hahah. Maddawg had a bunch of Juggs as you can read.

Werm tried to pump out another trans up top but as you can see, I was
already on top of it. :)

I got a bit cocky about my Destroyer fleet and tried to take on a Jugg.
It beat up all 3 of them tho' :)

During this time Vermeer had taken out Beowulf with his big invasion
order. I don't know what Maddawg was up to. Fighting Doomgaze I believe.<P>

I spent the whole time just making sure Werm didn't get off his island.
<P>

But somehow he got a trans out, and got one peon in it and made it
off his island to Doomgaze's place. My 2 Destroyers were not fast enough
to nail it before it landed.

I grabbed 6 peons, I don't even think I had a barracks and sent in
the Peon assassination Squad. You can see them heading after that one
black peon. Maddawg thought I was going for the Mages hahaa. I killed
that Werm peasant and got back into my transport and left. Most of the
peon squad survived with only slight to moderate injuries. They did their
job, kept Werm from making it off his Island alive :)

Enemy target was eliminated. Maddawg wanted me to run for his Juggs so he
could nail those Doomgaze troops :)

Beowulf was gone, Werm got invaded by Vermeer and I, and Doomgaze surrendered,
so the battle was over. Victory.

This game taught a few things. First the Destroyer rush is a good strategy
if you know they are rushing. That you shouldn't be predictable in your
strategies, I only was able to do this because I knew Werm always rushed
:) It also taught that everyone dies to Vermeer's super rush :)<P>
