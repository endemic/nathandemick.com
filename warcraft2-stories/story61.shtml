It was right after the Diablo Craze had died down. Gotcha and Mark had
gotten their own reg numbers as a Christmas present. Before that time, Gotcha and Warp always shared a reg number so we never played all together. So Warp,
Gotcha and I decided to get in our first on kali game with all 3 of us.
We didn't want any smurf game and we knew we could take some good players, or 
were pretty sure, so we go to kchat and say, Andrews boys are looking
for a 3on3. I talked some trash and we ended up getting Silverwolf, Kurdan,
and Vermeer, OG and Mage. Og dropped early on, so Mage decided to quit to make it fair.<P>

We picked FOC because that's one of my favorite maps and it's one where
you need to be very good at sea to win. High Seas Combat allows you to
hop, and do pretty much no sea and still win, and that's not what I wanted.
So I picked FOC.<P>

I was red, Warp as black, Gotcha was Aqua, Vemeer was Yellow, Silverwolf White,
and Kurdan Orange. We sent out scouts and discovered Blue and Purple were
free. Warp, and I got together our Juggs and headed down to Vermeer. I knew Vermeer's standard strategy is get a transport early and go tower the extra islands.So I got a transport early. I went over to blue and set up some towers. We
made quick work of the sea. Warp and I took Vermeer's Shipping down. I kept
killing Kurdan's foundry so he couldn't make Juggs. Gotcha did the same to him, so I heard. Vermeer sent an transport and landded on Warp's island, with his
peon, I believe. We knew Vermeer was up to his normal strat. I decided to allow him to take purple knowing that it would be quite easy to take it since it's "Deadman's Island" Warp invaded Kurdan with Ogres and he had NOTHING. I think
then he dropped. He might have just quit, i'm not sure. It wouldn't have
mattered he was dead. Gotcha invaded Vemeer, and took him quite easily with
a few Knights. About that time, in comes Silverwolf to Blue with his peons
looking for a new mine. hahahahah. That one was already taken. My towers
started firing at his guys. It was pretty funny.<P>

We noticed Vermeer had set up a nice camp on purple. Gotcha took care
of the Island with Knights and I believe Mages. After that, Vermeer surrendered.That left Silverwolf. He was making a mage tower. I went over and nailed
it on the sea. After that, it wasn't too long until Silverwolf surrendered too.
All and all it was a huge ass kicking! hahaha.<P>

Well that sure built up our self confidence. If we could take these guys,
our little team wasn't half bad :)<P>
