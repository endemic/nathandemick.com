Well Here is the situation. Gar had beaten me and Gotcha in the Gar's 
Story game (Read Gar's Story). Gar had beaten Vermeer in a game. So
Vermeer and Gotcha beat Keester and Gar for pay back in a game. Which
brings us to this story. Keester and Gar asked Gotcha and Me to play
them.

The map was plains of snow on low. This was before the patch came out.
I was yellow, Gotcha orange, Gar black, and Keester white. Really
interesting starting positions. The whole left side of plains was full
and Gar and Keester were in the middle between Gotcha and I.<p>

Gotcha and I went in early on Gar. We did some damage. The delay was
getting just awful. Keester sent all he had against me. I had my peons
all walled in with 2 barracks on the outside. My plan was that I would
build a lumber mill and get a tower up quick to kill those grunts. But
the delay was just so bad, my guys wouldn't do a thing. 
I sent some guys up to Keester's town. He had a tower by his peons. The
delay was so bad that my grunts would charge the tower even though I
told them not to. Then they ran away. It was so lame. My guys were outta
control. Then Keester and Gar dropped. DOH!<p>

So we went back. We had the game saved but we hadn't saved it in a long
time. So we started all over. This time the game went different. Gotcha
and I decided to go in even earlier on Gar since he knew we were coming.
I got my second barracks up quicker. I got the lumber mill up for the
tower. I kept sending everything I had against Gar. So did Gotcha.<p>

The game went different this time. I hate that crap but oh well.<p>

Keester attacked me a bit earlier this time. He had a lot of grunts and
he was a high level, but I took them out with my tower. Also, I was
making more grunts. After a lot of attacks Gar started to go DOWN. He
was able to hold off a lot of attacks but we wore him down. A lot of
Gotcha's Grunts went down to Peons. Gar tried to put up towers but
Gotcha and I took them down.<p>

I saw some of Gar's peons leaving. So
I sent 4 grunts to watch all the mines. I sent one to red. I sent the
rest to blue and aqua.<p>

I sent a peon off and built my blacksmith
in the top middle of the map, in the middle of nowhere. It was funny.
Gotcha found it. He goes "There is someone's blacksmith here!" I go yeah
mine! After the blacksmith was done, I built a tower by purple's mine. 
I then was about to build my 2nd hall. I had told Gotcha like 2 times
that I was taking purple. So he shows up there anyway. I quickly put
my hall up. I wasn't going to let Gotcha snag it.<p>

Well sometime around then, Keester sent up a bunch of footman to help
Gar out, but we took them down easily. Like I said my Grunts were
checking the mines. I found Gar's peons at blue's spot I think. I killed
them. Some got a way and wandered into my new town at purple. The tower
got one I think. One was able to get past the tower and hid in the
corner. I sent up a grunt to kill it.<p>

I knew that Keester(White) was going to get another Hall. I had purple
and Red watched. Gotcha had a town set up at aqua so that left Blue
free. I knew Keester was there. I went to Stronghold and got Ogres. Gotcha
wanted to work on Keester's town, so we sent everything against him. I
went in and started taking the towers out with my Ogres. He kept building
them. I started attacking his Lumber mill. I got it down to a sliver but
he kept attacking me, so I had to go fight. I came back and finished off
the lumber mill.<p>

Since I knew Keester must be at blue, I sent some guys over there. I
found a whole town going. I didn't think he would have that much but he
did. He was upgrading to Keep. 
Keester sent some footmen and started attacking Gotcha's 2nd town.
I sent over some grunts and he either killed Keester's guys before I got
there, or I killed them. I forget. So I sent bunch of Ogres over to
Keester's 2nd town. I took it down. I then went back and started working
on Keester's main town.<p>

It was pretty much a mop up operation. Gar was down to like one
lumber mill and a peon. Keester didn't even have Knights. I had a bunch
of Grunts and Ogres. Gotcha had footmen, Rangers and Knights.<p>

Around that time, Gar and Keester decided to surrender. Gotcha and I
were not done yet so after they surrendered, we stayed in the game and
finished off their stuff. We always finish off everyone's stuff. The
game feels more complete that way. A surrender is not satisfactory.
We also took most of these pictures :)
<p>

That game was so fun. It was quite a challenge!<p>

<p><b>Here is a picture of how I walled in. That is how you do it.
2 barracks on the outside and a tower inside. You can see by the stumps
how I was walled in. The trees are now gone in this picture but you
should be able to see what I did. This protected my peons enough
to keep me in the game strong. I had no troops to protect my town, but
walled in with a tower, I didn't need any.</b>

<b>Here is where Gar says the surrender. I replied that statement
meaning, you may surrender but we aren't ready to quit yet :)</b>

Here are the stats. The gold and lumber is a bit high for Gotcha and
I because we played quite a while after the left. As you can see,
Keester got almost as much gold as we did.</b>
