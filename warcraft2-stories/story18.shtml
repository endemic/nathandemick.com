Shlonglor,<p>
                I read your latest article about the two punks that kept on
saying no attacking for 15 min, no attacking 2nd town halls, no attacking
peroid!  Well I remember long time ago I played a team game (I can't
remember who my partener was) against HuevoMan and another guy named RedDog
(I think there is another guy named RedDawg on kali, don't mistake those for
eachother).  Even when we were in the wc2 chatroom these guys started
shooting their mouths off at my partner.  They said "I don't know if I want
to play with that guy (my partner) because he uses bad language."  My
partner replies "I only used bad bad language that game (some previous game)
because the other guy said something first."  So there was a little
conversation and then we started the game.<p>

  Well the first game we played I din't hear anybody say no grunt rushes,
and I even asked my partner if they said it, but neither of us heard it.  So
I attacked them with about 9 grunts (not using baracks first of course).
Then all I heard was one guy say "Asshole!"  and then they returned eveyone
to the chatroom (SIN SIN SIN!!!!!) where my partner informed me that he did
hear them say no grunt rushes (why didn't he tell me that before???)  I then
took the blame and we preceeded to play a second game.  Well they declared
Ogre rules at the begining of the game, so naturally I made ogres really
quick, and proceeded to attack their town :)  Then when I was attacking they
say "Hey!  We said Ogre Rules!!!"  I then reply "I know, I am attacking you
with an Ogre (dum ass), what is the problem?"  Then they try  to convince me
that "Ogre Rules" means that everybody must have ogres (or knights) before
anyone can attack.  So testing my patience I decide to let up for a second
(mercifull feeling).  So I back my ogres off out of his town a little ways.
Then I see my oponets ogre attacking me (YES!) so they cann't possibly have
any complaints now right?  Wrong!  Then bith at me somemore using foul
language (remember how concerned they were with bad language).  I try to
understand what could possible be wrong.  I found out what it was, I
wouldn't lay down and die for them :)  Well my partner at this time has
managed to round up a flying machine and comes to take a look at the
situation.  He agrees with me that these guys are complete morons.
<p>
Well, to make a short story...I destroy one guys town completly, then I make
my way to another town and destroy it.  Taking insults while I am doing
it...They must have been sooooo
pissed..HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA.......Then  eventually one guy is
eliminated and another just quits.<p>

Well, I would like to set the record strait on Ogre rules.  Ogre rules does
NOT mean that everybody must have ogres before an attack (only you).  Also,
when you declare "no grunt rushing" this could be interperted as "Ogre
Rules" or "No baracks first" <----This is the more common interpertatoin.
So if some one declares "no grunt rushing" ask them to specify.  And as for
HuevoMan and RedDog (not RedDawg) they are just a bunch of idots.  After I
won that game they went to another persons game and I also joined to warn
them about those two punks, but before I could say anything HuevoMan and
ReDog start to type "Noooo, don't let him in!!", "Get Jonny out", "Dont let
that jerk play" and the server kicked me out.. His loss...<p>

WARNING:<p>

DO NOT ------) EVER (--------- PLAY WITH HUEVOMAN OR REDDOG THEY ARE
COMPLETE AND TOTAL IGNORANT, IDIOTIC, STUPID, REALLLLLLY BAD WC2 PLAYERS WHO
SHOULD STICK TO PLAYING THE COMPUTER (that way they can only bitch at
themselfs).<p>

DIRECTIONS:<p>

So if you ------) EVER (--------- come across these two players tell them
that you have heard about their bad sportsmanship and would never ever play
a game with someone such as thereselfs.  You can win easily against them,
but they are hardly worth you precious time.<p>
