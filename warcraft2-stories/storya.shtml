Well it looks like this page got so popular, everyone decided to make a
story page too. If you look, every war2 page suddenly has a story page.
haha.  That's ok. A long time ago when I first came up with the
idea in December, I figured that no one would care. But everyone does
and that's cool. None of the other story pages can compare to this one. Other
people are not willing to spend 3 or so hours writing a story. haha.

<!-----------------CHRISM AND JONNY--------------------------------->
<hr size=2 width=90%>
Chrism and Jonny played a huge game. It was a 1 on 1 that
lasted for 2 hours. What was so amazing was the stats. I've never seen
stats this high before. The game went back and forth the whole time but
Jonny finally won. It is really amazing though because Chrism had 100
more kills. 
<a href="/war.jpg"> Take a
look at the stats.</a> You won't believe it.

I played the crappiest War 2 player ever! Heres what
happened: We started a 4 player game. I built my town. I had a town
hall, lumber mill, 2-3 farms, and maybe 7-9 peasants. This was about
5-10 minutes into the game. When, a peasant, who was not one of mine
walks into my village. The guy who was controlling that peasant types:
"Oh look a village, someone to beat up, ha ha ha". So he starts
attacking one of my peasants. So I set 2 peasants on his peasant and
killed him. Then I see the message that the guy, the guy who sent that
peasant, was eliminated from the game!!! About 10 minutes into the game
that guy still only had one peasant! And he sent him into my village to
attack me! And to top it off he was bragging about having someone's
village to beat up!!! Now thats a crappy player.<p>
