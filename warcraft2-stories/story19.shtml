This was one of the closest games I've had in a LONG time, It was
Great!! Shortly after the game starts Krieg tells me his partner is a
newbie, and I respond by saying it's ok because my partner is a newbie
also. So we have a vet and newbie on each team. Anyways I send my first
two Grunts to R-Dawgs's base and kill 2-3 peons before losing my guys.
Then I tell Machiavelli to send 2 guys to my base so that we can do a
joint attack. On the way to his base we encounter 3-4 footmen and wipe
them out. Our attack fails, and suddenly Krieg is all over my base! He
has me outnumbered 5-2 and I know I'm going to lose. I immediately seal
off my gold mine and start making a tower. I scream to Machiavelli that
I'm under attack and need some help. Machi comes by and helps me fight
off Krieg's attack. Shortly after that, Machi is getting invaded so I
send down some Grunts to help him. When I get there, I see all his poor
dead peons and Krieg's troops on the rampage. Poor Machiavelli tells me
all his peons were killed. Ok... I figure we better counterattack now so
Me and Machiavelli each send about 5 grunts toward Krieg's base. Much
to our dismay we discover his base is walled off and has two guard
towers not to mention some grunts. Too much to handle so we back off and
head towards green.<p>

Unfortunately, he too also has a tower and our counterattack is crushed.
Ok... I think to myself that it's not worth attacking them until they
come out of their bases so I concentrated on upgrading and expanding. I
expand to Orange's mine praying to god that nobody attacked me while I
was vulnerable. Luckily, all my peons got the hall built and the gold
started flowing again. I built a couple of farms and a cannon tower to
seal off my second mine from any ground attack. Krieg's zeppelin is over
my second mine but I'm not too worried about it.
There was a long
period of peace. During this period of time, I'm figuring that the enemy
is also expanding to their second mine too. I find Krieg's mine at 
at Red but he too has sealed off his base and builds a tower. Hmmm....
only way to get through that is Bloodlust.<p>

By this time, I have 4 barracks cranking out lvl 5 Ogres. I spot Green's
second mine at Purple and move in to attack, wiping R-dawg's forces
there. His counterattack manages to save his hall though. Then I finally
get Bloodlust and move in to attack Krieg's second mine. Unfortunately,
I stop my ogres a little bit within sight and he sees me Bloodlusting.
So he immediately attacks while only half my guys are Bloodlusted. I
still win but with more casualties then expected. I move my force in and
manage to destroy a barracks and his tower before Krieg's reinforcements
arrive. By this time, I had another wave ready to go in and managed to
wipe out Krieg's mine. Krieg says that he is dead and I think to myself
"cool :) " However, that was not true as I discovered later..<p>

During this whole time, I never heard a word from Machiavelli. I don't
know if he's alive or dead even. Machiavelli hasn't got another mine yet
so his resources are very limited and I've basically fighting Krieg and
R-Dawg by myself stretching my forces to the limit in the process.<p>

Then it happens... my second mine runs out and I've got about 5000 left.
I figure that the only gold left is in the center surrounded by trees.
So I build a hall and start chopping away. It was then that I realized
that R-dawg's army was about twice the size of my army. He had trained
more peons and rebuilt his mine at purple while I had been concentrating
on Krieg's mine. If R-Dawg attacks me, I'm dead... no income, 5000
gold... and about 8 Ogres and two Death Knights with no extra spells
after mining out two mines.<p>

Then, I discovered that the White mine was completely open!! I for some
reason thought that my partner was there but he wasn't. I slap down a
hall and move the THREE ogres I have to defend it. Meanwhile Krieg's
Zeppelin is hovering over my mine. If I don't get another farm up to
seal it off I'm toast. Sure enough here comes 6 of Krieg's Bloodlusted
Ogres ( I thought he was dead!!!) and 5 Knights and 3-4 archers from
R-Dawg. Poof, there goes all my peons and my hall. I move in 4 Ogres
that I had just trained and 2-3 others that I had to counterattack, but
they also got wiped out. Then, all of a sudden, It was the movie "The
Birds"! Four of R-Dawg's Gryphons start attacking me at different spots
on the map. I have no guard towers, no trolls, and 1700 gold. I kill two
of the Gryphons with my two Death Knights abut have no way possible to
kill the other two. ARRRGGGHHHHH!!! I'm gonna lose!! Luckily R-Dawg is a
newbie and didn't think to have his Gryphons target my Death Knights.
But then he invades with 4 Knights and 2 archers that were left from my
destroyed hall at white. I have about 2-3 Ogres defending my base and
somehow manage to beat off the attack with the help of my cannon tower.
One of my Death Knights was killed so I have one left. R-Dawg had one
last Gryphon left that was attacking my remaining troops with impunity.
My Death Knight didn't have enough mana to cast Death Coil on it but
luckily R-Dawg didn't know where he was.<p>

Eventually, he had enough mana to cast Death Coil and killed the Gryphon
and finally eliminated the air threat. Then I discovered that I had two
more Ogres sitting at Machiavelli's base and when I go to retrieve them,
I find that he has about 7 Ogres!! Alright!! Krieg has 5 ogres out there
someplace and I have no idea what R-Dawg has left. I don't even have
enough money to build another hall but I still have about 7 peons
chopping wood. I tell Machiavelli that we need to secure White's mine.
We go there but it is surprisingly vacant. I was expecting a town hall
with a contingent of guards but It was completely empty.
I then started the dreaded Peon gold train until I get enough to build
my hall. Then I think for a minute... Krieg isn't dead!! What if he
rebuilt his hall at Red's spot? So I send my balloon over and sure enough
I see a town hall with about 6-7 peons hauling gold. Man we have to take
him out now or it will be too late!! Machiavelli and I meet outside of
Krieg's mine and I bloodlust his Ogres and mine. We move in finally and
finally once and for all take out Krieg. If we had attacked a minute or
two later, I'm sure it would have been too late. I finally get enough
gold for a hall and the gold starts coming in. At this point, Krieg and
R-Dawg say that they are out of troops and money and the game ends.<p>

Not including the new troops that I trained from the newly acquired gold
I had 1 Dead Knight, 3 Ogres, and 400 gold left. Man what a game.<p>
