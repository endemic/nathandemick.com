It was the night before the big Old Skoolers vs Cases match. Everyone
happened to be around, probably preparing for the big match. We had the
whole posse there so we decided on a 4on4 game. We chose FOC on Low. YEAH!<P>

The teams would be Gotcha, Me, LrdSchroeder VS {{NaTe}}, Khisanth, Warangel,
& StormShadow. Clash of the Titans.<P>

We started off. I got Purple for the 123409325032984509 time. Backlash got
Red. Gotcha got blue and LrdSchroeder got Aqua. On there side, NaTe got bottom
right, yellow, Storm got White, Khisanth got Black and Warangel got Orange.
It was Top vs Bottom. Awesome.<P>

We worked out our game plan. Gotcha, me, and Lrd would go all Juggs. Backlash
would go all land. But Back didn't do the lumber cheat. hahahah Newbie. SO he
was a bit behind.<P>

I build my shipyard on the left side so Gotcha, Lrd's and mine could be
right next to each other for easy grouping. (Good Strat). I got up 2
shipyards at once with 2 peons repairing both of them. I got about 5 tankers,
maybe 6. I started pumping the Juggs. I had 0 land defense.<P>

I then quickly built an Oil Refinery. Oil Refinery? Shlonglor are you crazy?
In actuality, I said a while back, that Rifinerys can work if you are
going serious ships. With 2 Shipyards, no land forces, 5 tankers, that's serious
ships. Lrd did the same thing, got a refinery up.<P>

We planned on grouping our Juggs at Lrds place. Gotcha met up with me
and Lrd at Lrd's yard. I led the armada and we headed down between
Yellow and Orange. You can see the flow of our Ships in the following picture:<P>

I met up with limited resistance. Just then, their whole armada came in
from the right. Here is
<a href="PICS/s76b.jpg"><b>
picture 1</b></a> and
<a href="PICS/s76a.jpg"><b>
picture 2</b></a> from that first battle. Look at the 2nd one. 13 Juggs
on the screen haha. There were about 2-3 more up and to the left too.<P>

That battle went good for us. It came down to one of my Juggs and 3 of Lrd's
surviving. I had 2 more Juggs coming into the battle and Gotcha had 1
up a head of my 2. But in came more of the enemy fleet. They got my
one Jugg and Lrd's 3 Juggs. Rather then send in my 2 Juggs to be slaughtered,
I yelled to Gotcha in the other room <a href="http://games.nextlevel.net/~fraizer/SOUNDS/runaway.wav"><b>this.</b></a> hahaha. I ran with my 2 Juggs back
to Lrd's place. I had 2 on their way to Lrd's Yard from my Yards. Gotcha
was bringing in more from his place.<p>

Giant Sea battle number 2 was fought at Lrd's place. As you can
see by 
<a href="PICS/s76d.jpg"><b>
this picture</b></a> We won that quite easily. We had 7 Juggs in that picture,
while there was just 2 of theirs left, the Orange and Yellow one. (Nate and Storm).<P>

During this time, Storm and Nate invaded LrdSchroeder. They jacked him up
haha. Lrd was able to take a few hits on Storm's transport. It had 2
hit points left and he finished the transport off with a peon 
<a href="PICS/s76h.jpg"><b>
here</b></a> hahahah<P>

During this time Backlash invaded Khisanth. I don't think his initial invasion
was a success but he eventually over powered Khisanth and took control of his
Island. Khisanth managed to get together an armada of 5 Battleships. He snuck
around the backside of our island. He started attacking someone, I might
have been me, I forget. We regrouped our Juggs and headed up to
get rid of Khis' fleet. After his fleet was stopped, the sea battle was over.
We had won 3on4. They all went sea while only 3 of us went sea.<P>

<a href="PICS/s76f.jpg">
<b>Gotcha's Armada</b></a> That's what he had left over, after the battles.
I decided to send one Jugg with him because he was going Sub Hunting and
I didn't have a flyer.<P>

After Khisanth was taken, I went down and took Warangel's yard. I then proceded
on to attack Storm's. Gotcha went and 
<a href="PICS/s76g.jpg">
<b>attacked Nate's Place</b></a> Someone was making
subs however. I think it was Warangel not sure. I had to wait for Gotcha to
take his fleet down there and lay waste to the Subs. Then it was safe to 
proceed.<P>

What was funny was I still didn't even have a barracks. All I had on my island
was 4 Guard towers and none of them were even walled in.<P>

NaTe tried to get a transport away but <a href="PICS/s76e.jpg"><b>we were on it.</b></a> 

Storm had placed both of his Barracks on the sea. I guess he is one
cocky bastard to assume that they are going to win the sea like that hahaha.
I took both his barracks. I got his 2 yards. We found that Warangel was
up at fortress and I spoted a Dragon Roost. I quickly informed the team.
But Gotcha found he could get the 
<a href="PICS/s76i.jpg"><b>Dragon
building on the sea.</b></a> As you can See there.<P> Backlash was on his
way but he wasn't going to make it in time. Luckily, Gotcha's Juggs got it.
Backlash landed on Warangel with 3 transports full of crap. Catapults, the whole lot. It was awesome. I invaded too at the same time with some Ogres and a cat.
BUT, Warangel had started up another Dragon Roost on the other side. He had
towers preventing us from working our way in. I loaded up my guys and
went around the corner and 
<a href="PICS/s76j.jpg"><b>
Started attacking Warangel's Tower.</b></a> As you can see he tried to
peon rush the catapult. But I was ready for that. Dead peon. But Just as
I took his tower, out popped a dragon. CRAP! I ran for it. I got
in my transport and I did
<a href="http://games.nextlevel.net/~fraizer/SOUNDS/runaway.wav"><b>this.</b></a>
I got in my trans and ran for the border. I trained about 4 axers. It was
the last of my money. During this time, WarAngel's Dragons were going
about the map Raping our guys and being a general pain in the ass.<P>

During this time, Stormshadow was in his town playing with himself
<a href="PICS/s76k.jpg"><b>
as you can see here.</b></a> 
 
Eventually, we were able to kill WarAngel's Last Dragon. Check out this
<a href="PICS/s76l.jpg"><b>
picture.</b></a> What a shot. haha.<P>

NaTe was busy making 
<a href="PICS/s76m.jpg"><b>
pretty pictures</b></a> in his town too.<P>

Gotcha was yelling to us that Strom was his. He invaded storm and the
way Gotcha tells it, he beat the crap outta him with peons hahah. He
then went in on Nates town. He sappered Nate's little tower contstuction,
and took it down. He then beat the crap outta Nate
<a href="PICS/s76n.jpg"><b>
with Peons</b></a> too.<P>

WarAngel was gone, Storm and Nate were almost gone, I wanted someone
to attack so I went to Khis' place. I got this 
<a href="PICS/s76o.jpg"><b>
awesome picture</b></a>.<P>

Man that is the kind of game Gotcha said he could retire on. That is
a game where using the same amount of gold and resources we just out
played them. This was a QUALITY win. A lot of other games you can blame
the loss on 2nd mines and so on, but here all you got to blame
is yourself :)<P>
