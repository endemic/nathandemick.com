The following was my first War 2 Story, so as you can see it was kinda 
raw :)<P>

<hr size=2 width=90%> 
I played one of the best players yet his name was
Psychodad. Heres how the game went. We played fierce ocean combat.
I started off normal. I had 3 level 2 Juggernaughts. When to my surprise
one got sunk by some subs. So I took the other 2 juggs and hid them.
I had not even upgraded to keep yet, so I did not have any subs, or
flyers. It scared the crap outta me, usually no one is that fast at
building a shipyard. So I upgraded to keep, built a Goblin Alchemist
and a zepplin. Then I brought my Juggs outta hiding and sank all his
subs, but not before he destroyed my shipyard and foundry. So 
I destroyed his shipyard and foundry with my Juggs.<P>

I rebuilt my
shipyard and foundry. But then, out of the blue, there were 6 level
4 knights on my island beating me up. He took out almost everything
on my island. But I built a transport and escaped with one or two
peasants. I built another town on another island. Then Psychodad types
"You surrender?" So I type "nah".<P>

I started putting out sappers and
grunts on the first island he was attacking.. 
I charged his knights with a sapper and took out about 3. 
That left 3. I brought their power down some more with grunts and
then killed all but one with my juggs. Not before he destroyed
my barracks. That left one knight. His knight destroyed almost everything
but he made the mistake of attacking my shipyard with that knight.
So I hit him with my Jugg.<p>

But then He discovered my new town. He sent
another 6 knights on that island. He destroyed everything in my second
town, but not before I sent my peasants back to my first town, hahaha.
I rebuilt my first town. But then I noticed he had gone to a second
island. So I sent over 1 grunt, and 1 axeman. I killed everything on
that Island. I then started attacking his main island. I thought I made
sure that he had not rebuilt his shipyard. I went to another island and
started another town. I kept invading his island and when I though
I almost had destroyed him. To my surprise I saw 4 level 2 battleships
coming toward my town!!! He had set up another town down south!!!
What a surprise. So since I had two shipyards (hint hint) I was able
to out ship him and destroy his ships and shipyard, but not before
he destroyed much of first town. So I had to rebuild my entire town
again on my 3rd island. He attacked my 2 islands again, and I fought him
off. I went back to my 2nd Island and rebuilt my town. So I had 3
islands. Then I was able to attack his new island and another one he had
built. I finally won. The game went 4 hours!! 
One of the reasons he did so well is because he had one transport, from
his first shipyard, which I could never find or destroy. That helped him
the whole game. This guy was so good. Many
times in the game I was almost dead.<p>
