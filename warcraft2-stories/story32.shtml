     Well, I was hanging out in kchat, talking to Gotcha and Shlonglor when 
Vermeer asked me if I'd partner with him in a game.  Apparently some people 
wanted to play him.  I told him sure, and we set up the game and moved to TNP 
to play.  The game was plains of snow, High resources.  (That game is played
far too often methinks)  Our opponents were TitanPR and BigBlu^.  So we
started playing, the game was running fairly smoothly, not too much
netlag.  Well, Vermeer decided to do the quick grunt attack (7 or 8
level 3 grunts), and I decided that I'd back him up in that, because my
number one rule of playing is to back up my partner.  So we both built
grunts, killed Titan's peons, after which we ran from his towers, then
we went and found the one hole in BigBlu's wall and killed off all of his
peons.  I held off an attack from BigBlu, losing only my farm, and then
Vermeer and I built sappers and took Titan down.<P>

     Now, Titan was rather unhappy, and said "Anybody can do that".  He
insisted that he much preferred ogre rules, because it made for a longer
game.  I told him that that just leads to ogre rushes, and I'd gladly prove it
by playing him a 1 on 1, plains on high, with ogre rules in effect.  He
was sort of noncomittal on that, so I pointed out that high resources tend
to lead to that, and that medium resources are even worse.  (Trust me, they
are.)  Low resources are really the only way to GUARANTEE build up.  Now,
at the time I said this, I was operating under the assumption that EVERYONE
plays under the town hall first rule.  That IS something against which there
isn't a defense.  On high resources, there are several equally valid 
strategies you can adopt which can protect you against those TOWN HALL FIRST
early grunt attacks.<p>  

     So we agreed to play on low, and to let Vermeer sit in the corner and
build blimps.  So we started the game, I'm happily building my town hall,
when Titan says "I don't know the colors.  Can you tell me where you are?"
So I told him, not wanting him to argue later that I only won due to the
unfair advantage of knowing the colors.  Soon after, 
I get attacked by a grunt and a peon.

I realized he did the barracks first
trick on me.  We start arguing about whether or not this is the same thing
as the early grunt attacks on High resources.  He insists that it is, I
point out that it isn't, because there ARE things you can do agaisnt the
High resource attacks WITHOUT doing the same thing.  When Azure and I
smurfed as Sapper and Kaboom, building only sappers and demo teams, and
no grunts, we held of some of those early grunt attacks and went on to win.
There ARE defenses against it, and while I wish people wouldn't do it so
much, I don't consider it to be the same as barracks first, and I wish
people would realize this.<p>

     Anyway, then Titan asks where Vermeer is, and Vermeer tells me he is going
to kill Titan with only peons.  So Vermeer tells Titan where he is, and
beats up the grunt with his peons.  

Then he comes and rescues my farm from Titan's peon.
Vermeer also
beats up Titan's stuff with his peons.

We talk for a bit, before Vermeer's
peons finish Titan off and our allied victory brings us to the 
Victory Screen.
Now, I'm not mad at Titan, he was trying to
do this to prove a point.  But for all of you out there who think that early
grunt attacks are unstoppable, BS, or in some other way illegal, they aren't.
I almost never do them, and I almost always stop them.  Barracks first IS 
unstoppable, and it is QUITE different.<p>

I almost played with them. I'm glad I didn't get mixed up in this mess
:) Man I never thought of Barracks first on low. Now that is LOW!<br>
