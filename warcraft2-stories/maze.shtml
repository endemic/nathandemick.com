It had been about a year since I'd really played maze. I had had a few
sappers only smurf games but no real games. Man a year already? Time flies.
Anyway, we  (Gotcha, Warp, others) decided to start playing maze again.
<P>

I got into a game with LeMaitre and Creed against Mage, Storm and Crimson.
Creed went human. DOH. Crimson went human too, the rest orcs. Lemaitre got
aqua, I got Blue, Creed got white, Storm orange, Crimson black, and Mage red.
(For once red!=dead). Since i was blue, I walled in and went straight up to ogres. I got a flyer over to Lemaitre who is yelling about getting attacked by
Knights. There are level 3 Crimson Knights attacking him. He was getting
his ass kicked. Man I had to laugh at that. I tried to send over some
Ogres to help but they got lost. Some of my grunts finally got there. I 
fought off one little attack from him. I then totally forgot all about him.
I walled in a second mine and started going for it. 
Lemaitre started talking about how he couldn't find his 2nd mine. hahahha.
They other side started getting lust. They kept going in on creed and beating on him. I sent in some Ogres
to save him a few times. I don't know If I was saving him but he looked like
he sure needed some help. Creed got some mages and said, protect the mages. I
got about 8 Ogres around his mages and we start off for the enemy. But then
creed walks in to a crapload of Ogres. Nice recon dude! :) Those mages went down. I got together a bunch of ogres and went in on storm. I got his mound.
I then tried to get into his 2nd mine but no luck. I killed a lot of ogres but
eventually they were overtaken. Crimson was really laying on the pressure with
his knights. Eventually, my 2nd mine went out. I was getting the 3rd one going
when Crimson sent in a bunch of knights. I had the place walled in with a barracks. Crimson's Knights were wacking away on it when i see some Creed Mages.
Awesome. All he had to do was blizzard all those knights and I woulda been ok.
But he starts walking away with the mages. I start yelling blizzard blizzard.
He took a while then turned around and came back. But by that time the Knights
were in. All my peons and the mages were dead and my empire was done. I think
I did good that game ;) Pretty soon it was all over. Lemaitre got ogres but
never got up to lust. We got wasted. It was some pretty sorry playing ;)

I wasn't impressed with how Lemaitre did and he admited himself he sucked it
up that game, so I decided why not Gotcha? He's good isn't he?<P>

This time It was Me, Gotcha, Creed vs Mage, Storm and Crimson. I got
aqua, Gotcha got white, Creed red, I think storm got black, mage blue,
and crimson orange. I'm not really sure. Well almost instantly, Gotcha
goes: "I'm out." I'm like crap what happened? He got rushed and he had
set up a wall in on the left side of white. (Look up the map page on Maze)
But he left the bottom part wide open. So whoever, i think it was mage, walked
around to the bottom and got his whole town while gotcha's guys were stuck
walled outside his town on the left side. Doh. Just then in came a bunch
of Grunts on my place. I had a barracks up and my cannon was going up. 
I lost my barracks and they almost got in. I took all my wood peons repairing
to keep them out. That put me in the stone age. Gotcha quit the game, he was
dead. I was back in 1952 technology wise. Pretty soon Storm comes in with
sappers and ogres. But I was able to keep him out only using peons. :)
No one gets in a Shlong wall in! :) Storm sent another raiding party with
sappers again, but I kept him out again. hahaha. I started talking it up.
"You can't get into my town fool!" I knew we were dead. It was 3on2 and
I certainly wasn't doing any good. I asked creed how he was doing and 
he said pretty good. I really didn't believe him. haha. I snuck out a
peon and got a 2nd mine. I had it walled in with some towers. But pretty
soon, in came the dks, lusted ogres. I was just going to Stronghold haha.
I went down. What a slaughter!

So we go for game 3 in a row. Same teams. I got blue, Gotcha white, Crimson
Aqua, the 3 best spots, and Crimson got black, Mage orange, Storm red.
A little way into the game, Gotcha goes, i'm dead. I'm like AGAIN? CRAP.
I can't remember much about this gmae. So many Maze games.
I got my place walled in. I went up to Ogres and took a look at Gotcha's town.
He had a ton of Ogres beating on his town and they just got lust. I was
almost at lust. As soon as I got lust, I went up and attacked. After
that it was a long line of Ogre battles. I tried to get into Storm's second
mine but it was too well protected. I snuck in Mage's back door and got into
some fights with his ogres. Storm mined out his 2nd mine and set up
at a mine right next to me. I got some Ogres in and did some damage. Storm
set up the sapper buildings and the dk building. He was planning on screwing
me up. I set up my dk building. I noticed Gotcha had Ogres. I guess he
had come back from the dead. but the punk stole my 3rd mine :) Storm
got some sappers and I charged them. I got them but I was losing lots of
Ogres. I sent in a big group of Ogres in a suicide charge when I see a bunch
of Black Ogres. I check the allies menu, hey blacks on my side. AWESOME.
It was creed. He helped me take Storms mine. We then worked our way around
to all of Storm's barracks. I set up a 3rd hall top right. I was mining
Gotcha's mine super long distance. About 2 screens distance my peons
were hauling gold. I went up to Mages place and Gotcha had some Ogres along
with Creed's beating on him. To my surprise the game was over. We won? haha.
I guess Creed was playing super awesome (like always) and had taken
on all 3 of them. I sure wasn't a lot of help. I did take on a bunch of Mage
and Storms Ogres but other then that..... I finally won one! Gotcha too!
Well creed won it :)

Well I was feeling pretty good about those Maze games so I decided to take
on Enrique and Ricardo who a year ago were a really good match on this
map. I figured they were around the same ability as us. Well I got
white, Warp Blue, Gecko Orange. I'm not sure what anyone was at. Gotcha
and I went in on Gecko early. Gecko tried to get in on me, but Warp took
his guys attacking me out eventually. We got gecko, killed him like a newbie.
However while we were wasting our time on Gecko, Ricardo and Enrique had
just been building away. They where HUGe. They had a ton of bloodlusted
Ogres. Ricardo sent 10 grunts to warp. Warp didn't have a cannon tower
so he got creamed. He was out. Ricardo then beat the crap outta me and Gotcha.
We all went down like newbies. But I can take satisfaction in the fact
that we beat the crap outta Gecko. Took him down like a newbie. Screw you
Gecko!
<a href="PICS/maze4.jpg"><b>

Hahah. Gecko calls that a win for him. He got his ass eliminated like
a NEWBIE!<P>

We played again, same teams. I got red, Warp black, Gotcha Orange. Enrique
got white, ricardo blue, gecko aqua, the best 3 spots. DOH. I was doing
pretty good until my mine ran out. Enrique had built a cannon tower
at my 2nd mine and walled it in with 2 farms. I eventually got it
back a LONG time later. I was screwed. Warp had to keep saving me. We
went down and attacked Gecko a few times but didn't get very far,
cuz I had no darn mine! Gotcha, Warp and I got in on Enrique
and reeked some serious havoc. Then Ricardo dropped. We were doing pretty good.
I won't be a dick and say that drop cost us the game, but I will :) Once
the save was reloaded, they did things different and we didn't do so good.
Which is what happens everytime an old save is loaded up it seems.
It was shortly over. They just out did us. Gotcha and Warp were killed. 
I was the only one left. I had one place left alive. You can
see Enrique and Gecko trying to get into a 
<a href="PICS/maze5a.jpg"><b>
Shlonglor™ Wall in.</b></a> In vain that is hahaha. Shlonglor™ wallin's
are the toughest things on earth. Gecko, the moron that he is, 
<a href="PICS/maze5b.jpg"><b>
sends in some dragons.</b></a> Oh no! Not Dragons! What ever will I do
against Dragons with 4 Guard towers? Gecko realized he wasn't smart enough
to take my wallin. So he Death and Decayed the whole mess. 
The game was over.
<a href="PICS/maze5c.jpg"><b>
the stats.</b></a> Don't believe the stats about Gecko being the good
player. It was Enrique and Ricardo. Gecko just got a lot of our peons
as they walked around and mined. WUSSY kills.<br>

We went for a 3rd game. I got red, Gotcha Orange, Enrique Black, I think
Warp got white. Gecko got aqua, and Ricardo blue. Man why do we always
get all the shitty spots? Warp went down early. Gotcha and I took enrique. He survived, and managed to set up another town below. Gotcha was doing awesome.
I had a lot of trouble getting a 2nd mine. I walled myself out of the 2nd
mine with like 2 peons mining it. Doh, I had to chop into it. So that put
me way behind. It was going pretty good when Ricardo dropped. There was
no save. Enrique was going up to keep at his place with Gecko protecting him.
I had finally got up to lust. With Ricardo gone, it was clear that we would
win the game so they quit the game. They claim that game was easily
theirs. 
<a href="PICS/mage6.jpg"><b>
Look at the stats.</b></a> Gotcha was kicking some ass, and I had some kills.
I'm not totally convinced that we were going to lose. Sure Gecko and Ricardo
were out mining us, but that doesn't always mean we are going down. But based
on the out mine and the fact that it was 3on2, they probably would
have won. But their win wasn't assured. But I'll give them that win.<P>

Why was this not an andrews boys game you might ask? Why weren't any
of these games andrews boys game? Because it's land. Andrews boys
are all about water. Warp can't play land worth a damn. :)<P>

We played another game that night. Me, Gotcha and Warp vs Ricardo, Enrique,
and Mage I believe. I went in early and took Enrique. Took him DOWN. He
manged to survive with a hall and some peons off in the middle of nowhere. I
don't call that surviving. But Gotcha and Warp didn't do their job. They
both went down and left me by myself. I was playing awesome too. So it
was all over. No stats or anything...<br>

We played another game 3on3 on Maze. I don't remember the teams
exactly. I think it was me, Ricardo and Warp vs dor and 2 others I can't
remember who.  2 others. I got ganked because of some pretty poor positioning. 
dor and some other guy double teammed me. Ricardo and Warp tried to save me
but my place eventually went down. I went and hid in Ricardo's town with
my 1 peon :) Ricardo and Warp managed to take the other 3, 2on3. They 
slaughtered them. I didn't manage to get any screen shots. I don't know why.

We played another game with Me, Gotcha, Lemaitre vs Mage, Storm, and
Crimson I think. Not to sure about who we were playing against. I did
a wallin with a farm. Storm came up and started building towers. 
He jacked me up bad. He built cannons and everything. I got out some cats.
Pretty soon, Crimson had blizzard and I was back in 1952 again, level 1 grunts.
He Blizzarded the whole place and came in. I had snuck a peon bottom right
next to LeMaitre and he built a hall and a tower. Crimson came down and
beat it up. They took out Gotcha, he got screwed over. He was able to go
in and almost get Crimson's hall but Stormshadow saved him because I wasn't
around to help. Lemaitre kept getting his peons blizzard because he hadn't
walled them in properly. It was soon over. Man I kick ass at maze!
