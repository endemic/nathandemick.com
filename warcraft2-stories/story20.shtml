Muzzy and I decided to have ourselves some smurfy fun. I decided to play
as CrappySmurf and Muzzy as BabySmurf. Muzzy served the game.
We got 3 guys to join. They decided to let the smurfs be teammates. (Good
choice) and they were quite sure they could kick some smurf ass.
haha.

The map was Spiral of course. The resources were medium. I was purple,
the crappiest one. Muzzy was red. Kragen was Blue. Tyr was orange and
Slayer was Aqua.

<p>

Since I was purple and Muzzy was red, we decided to deny Orange his oil.
We knew if we could keep one off the sea, the rest would die. So I built
my oil rig on the left and Muzzy built his on the right, making sure
Orange would get no oil. I sent my second oil tanker scouting while my
oil rig was being made. I went up to Blue and saw he already had his
rig almost up. Further along then mine. Muzzy and I planed on meeting in
the middle with our juggs. I built a second shipyard. I made my 2 juggs
and as I was going up to meet Muzzy when I saw a blue Jugg coming my
way. I go "oh crap Blue has juggs."
Immediately sank his one jugg with my two. I then go to Muzzy
"nevermind, not any more :) " We head up to get blue. Just then an aqua
destroyer was hacking on my jugg. I started getting it but it ran away.
So we head up. We had trouble finding the Foundry but Muzzy finally
found it. I got rid of the oil rig. Aqua sent up some Destroyers.
<b>OH NO. DESTROYERS VS JUGGS! WHAT WAS I TO DO?</b> Anyway those
Destroyers went down so quick.
We got rid of some Blue Juggs that
popped out I think. All four of my juggs had about 50 or so hit points
left. Blue made a catapult and sent it in. But I noticed the hit and run
catapult trick. I knew this guy was probably good. Well good can't do
crap vs about 8 juggs. So we took the guys shipyard and stuff down.
<p>

It was then I go "head to aqua", but I discover that orange has built a
shipyard. He built it nowhere near any oil so I wasn't too worried. I set
my Juggs on it and took it down. I then headed to aqua. We wasted Aqua's
shipyard and stuff. I headed up and got rid of Aqua's oil refinery.
I knew this guy was new when I saw the Oil refinery. I got rid of all
Aqua's stuff.<p>

We got flying machines and saw that Blue was getting some good stuff, so
we knew we had to take him down. So I guess Muzzy landed on his island.
I'm not sure what he did. All I know is the next time I flew over I see
Muzzy had built a town hall on blue's island, had barracks there, a
Goblin Alchemist and a bunch of towers. I flew over Orange. He had
himself a nice little Sim City. plenty of towers. All the crap. But he
was so far behind in mining. I knew that he had no plans to attack
anyone so I left him alone. He had his little city to run, haha.<p>

So I fly over Aqua, He has some catapults and like 1 level 2 footman
and 2 level 2 or so Archers. I sent over a transport with 4 level 5 
Ogres. I took out his whole place. he kept sending in footman after
foot man but could do nothing vs 4 Ogres. I got bloodlust and sent in
some more guys. I took aqua out. I built a town hall there and a town
hall on my island. I mined 2 mines. I built a barracks there and a 3rd
shipyard. Just for fun. We noticed Orange had finally decided to 
head to a second mine. The way he was mining, I bet he had like 4
peasants on Gold.<p>

It was about this time that the three guys said that the smurfs were
really good players. I go "I've played one or two games before." These guys
were really nice. Usually when I beat up on people, they call you
cheaters, start making excuses or worse. But not these guys. They were
really nice. They had some honor. They sure were not punks.<p>

I guess Muzzy had totally taken out Kragen, Blue. So that left Orange.
He had mages and all that. Lots of towers. He set up his second hall. I
kept attacking him with bloodlusted Ogres. It was cool because he kept
casting Blizzards on his own stuff. One time I was able to take out 2
mages and a catapult with only 2 bloodlusted Ogres. Anyway we beat him
down. Muzzy then came in with Dragons, Ogres and all that. He put up a
barracks on Orange's Island. I put up 2 barracks on the island to
counter Muzzy's move :) . 
I Death and Decayed the whole place. We were able to take out the
Towers, Knights and Mages.
I then sent in a large amount of peons.
So did Muzzy. We then beat on him with bloodlusted peons. I hasted the
peons just for fun.<p>

I think it was around then that Orange said "is one of you Shlonglor?". I
said yes. I guess he reads my page. He said he likes my page and reads
my Strategies. He then said he thinks he needs to read them some more.
haha. Pretty nice guy.<p>

That game was lots of fun. I sure do enjoy Smurfing.<p>

Muzzy is sure a great partner.<p>
