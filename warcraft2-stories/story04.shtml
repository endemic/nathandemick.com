I watched Warpmaster play Gryphon man. The Level they
played was fierce ocean combat. There where two other players Orange and
White. Warpmaster went in early with a bunch of battleships and attacked
white. He destroyed white's Oil Rig, Shipyard, Foundry, some Archers, 
and his Blacksmith. Then He went for Orange. When Warp found orange, he
found out that orange was already building a second town on another
island. But the Town hall could be hit by the sea! So Warp started
hitting orange's town hall. Just then orange sent in a Gryphon. This was
super early in the game, I don't know how he got a Gryphon so soon. Well
Warp had no destroyers so he started making some. The Gryphon sank a
Battleship and Warp hid the rest. Warp made 2 Destroyers which were
level 5 and sent them in. He went back to attack Oranges town hall. So
orange sent in his Gryphon. Warp wasted it with his 2 Destroyers. BUT
just then Orange sent in 4 Gryphons. They wasted his 2 Destroyers. 
This was so amazing that In like a minute or two orange had
4 more Gryphons!!! This was super early in the game. Me and Warp were totally
shocked. Then we did a fly by of his village. He had 4 Gryphon Aviaries!!
So Warp started making more destroyers. Warp sent up 4-5 Destroyers and
attacked but Orange sent in like 12+ Gryphons and sank all the
Destroyers!!!! So Orange sent over a transport and built another a town
on another island. He was mining 3 mines at once! So Warp made his
second town and hid it in the upper right island. He made a second
shipyard. Orange went to fourth island. He had four islands! Buy that
time he had like 20+ Gryphons, man oh man. So Warp made tons of archers
and Mages. Just then White invaded
Orange. White attacked one of orange's towns and started building his
town hall even though he had not yet destroyed Orange's hall. White
destroyed all of oranges stuff on that island. But just then Orange sent
in all his Gryphons. White got totally thrashed. Orange rebuilt his town
hall on that island.
Warp went to a third
island. White, after losing his battle for Orange's island, quit the
game. By that time Warp had like maybe 9 Destroyers. So he brought them
by one of Orange's islands. Orange attacked them with maybe 15+
Gryphons. Warp killed a whole lot of them and lost only one ship. Never
attack destroyers with Gryphons! So then Orange ran for it. 
He invaded Warp's third island with Knights and Gryphons. Warp fought
off the attack barely. Since Orange lost that battle, he decided to
attack Warp's second island with lots of Gryphons. 
He destroyed everything on that island.
Then He attacked Warp's main island with lots of Gryphons. 
Warp thrashed his Gryphons. He polymorphed a bunch, and hit the rest with
archers and destroyers. Orange ran. 

Then Orange sent in another load of guys and
totally killed Warps third island. Orange destroyed Warps town and everything on
that third island. So Warp invaded Oranges island. The same one that
White had invaded. Warp destroyed orange's town hall.
Me and Warp both thought that Warp
was screwed. So then Orange attacks 2 of Warp's destroyers with 
about 5 Gryphons. The Gryphons had really low health so Warp killed all
of them. Me and Warp were screaming "YEAH" after each one he killed. It
was so cool. So then Orange attacked Oranges main island again with
Gryphons of course. Warp polymorphed a bunch and the rest he killed with
Archers. I reached over and typed on Warps keyboard to orange 
"Sure are a lot of
sheep on my island, haha." So Orange types are you going to finish me
off? We were totally surprised. Warp and I thought he was dead for sure.
So Warp goes in and kills all of Orange's 4 islands. What was so cool
about this game is that I have never seen that many Gryphons in the 
Game before. That is all Orange really made. That and a few knights and
ships. I bet Warp killed 40+ Gryphons. That is about 100,000 Gold! By
the end of the game Warp had only mined about 110,000 Gold, while orange had
mined over 180,000 Gold!!!!! I had never seen Gryphons do so much
damage. But Orange lost the game since he only made Gryphons. He never
healed them at all. If he would have even healed them, I bet he would
have won. Orange never made any guys besides a few Knights, Ships and
tons of Gryphons. He had 5 Gryphon Aviaries! If he would have balanced
his forces out a little more he would have totally thrashed Warp.
That was one of the coolest games I've ever watched.<p>
