I start this game with a guy named Zaratharusa who claims he is a member of 
a clan on IWL. Just to set the record strait, most people on IWL are alot 
better than me. The game starts... (no way out of this maze)  I am red, he 
is white. I start pumping out footman, then Kights.  I get off on the wrong 
foot. I have about 5 knights and 5-10 footman, when I get a glimps of his 
army. I'm thinking, crap, not again.  He begins to attack slowly.  With 
sappers.  He gets a couple good shots in.  I've lost about 3 knights and 
4 footman while he has used a mere 3 sappers.  Pretty soon 1 on my 3 barracks 
is toast.  I'm thinking, I want to win.  I don't usually do this, but I 
had no other choice.  I wasn't going to lose.  I quit with the land force, 
secretly started another mining operation at the middle left, and began 
pumping out peasants like crazy. At the same time I started another mining 
operation at the top left corner. I was producing peasants like crazy. As 
you might expect, my gold was booming. 3 mines at once with close to 10 
peasants at each mine.  Up went 3 gryphon aviaries, and I was on my way. 
I covered the map with flying machines. I soon realized that my plan just 
might work.  HE HAD NO AXETHROWERS! Unfortunately he had about 5 death knights.
<p>

After another 10 minutes my second mine had blown up, my first town was toast, 
and he had discovered my second mining operation.  I tried my best to weed 
out the death knights. I used my peasants, footman, you name it. Hey, I 
managed to take all of those suckers! The only reason why... he was over 
confident. He thought the footman and peasants were my last.  Just when he 
finished my townhall I started to laugh. I mean, *really* laugh. 
(not through messages!) I bet he was thinking, "now where is that last 
peasant of his?". Oh, boy, flying into his town with 25 gryphons was fun.  
He was like, #*&!*@E#@#!!!  I just had a blast taking out all those ogres. 
Helpless ogres. hahaha<p>

This is Zarathustra, the guy who lost to Thorax in one of your new stories.
<p>
The really funny thing is that after I had killed his big town and a few more peons he started with
a bunch of typical newbie stuff like "how did you build so fast?"  and "I always loose."  I totally
ate up all the crap.  I guess the lesson is: never slack off.
