Well this was the match up you guys were waiting for. For about a month,
I had Steve Borosh's strategy guide up. If you read it, you knew how
crappy it was.<p>

Steve Borosh finally got on Kali. He challenged me to a match. I
said ok on Spiral, Medium resources. If I lost, I had to take down my
pages making fun of him. If I won, he had to make some page saying how
great I am. I told him he didn't have to do that if I won. I also said
if he stayed till the end, as in didn't wuss out, I would ditch my copy
of his strategy page.<p>

This match was to determine who knew what they were talking about me or
Steve the defense king.<p>

Well Steve showed up on Kchat at the time we agreed on. He was playing
under the name DEFIANT. Caps lock, that should tell you the outcome of
this story :). I then looked at his reg number. 12933! I think he got
Kali a few days ago :) Well we cut the crap and went straight to war2.
<p>

The map was Spiral, Medium Resources. I was in Red's spot and Steve was
in Orange. I started off. I wasn't too worried. How good could he
be?<p>

After getting about 8 or so peons, I threw up my Shipyard. I got a tanker
building my oil rig in the middle and built another tanker. I then put
up my foundry. My foundry was about 1/2 done when it started to get hit
by a destroyer! A destroyer! Well I knew I had the game won. My foundry
was completed a little while later. My peon popped out and his destroyer killed
him. I went to build my first Jugg when I noticed I didn't have enough
lumber. DOH. So I got some more lumber and trained my Jugg. The Jugg
popped out and by that time Steve had 2 Destroyers on my Foundry. I
casually went down and sank the first Destroyer. The connection was really
nice so Steve was able to move around with his 2nd Destroyer. But I sank it
too. After all that time, those destroyers had taken only 200 hit
hit points off my foundry. It was barely on fire. Does that tell you how
much Destroyers suck?<p>

I headed across to the other side of the stream and found Steve's
shipyard. It was in the middle of the left side of the island! Not near
any oil at all. I went down to the oil spot excepted to see an Oil rig
and some tankers but that was too much to expect. I had another Jugg and
I went to the oil spot on the other side. No oil rig either! I typed to
Steve. "Don't you think you need some oil?" Here is his exact reply:
"?????." hahaha. Well on my return trip with my Jugg from the right side of his
island, I noticed he was building a hall by the inner mine. What was he
thinking? That I wouldn't see it and maybe I wouldn't attack it with my
Juggs? No such luck :) During that time, my Juggs on the left finished off
Steve's shipyard.<p>

He got finally got the hall completed and I sorta killed his peon that
made it :)

Steve then proceeded to build a tower by the sea. hahahahahaha. One shot
and it went down. He tried the catapult but since the response was so
nice, he didn't have a chance in hell of hitting my jugg.
<br clear=left><p>

Since I didn't have to worry about Steve getting on the Sea ever, I
decided to introduce him to the Sapper Strategy. I put up 4 Taco
bells. In the meantime, I put up another shipyard and started whipping
out the Juggs. I started them on destroying his mine. :) Standard Spiral
Strategy.<p>

<img src="/homes/csu/1995/fraizer/www/war/STEVEsteve5.jpg" align=left> 
I got a boatload of Sappers and went in on Steve. He placed all his
buildings in the perfect place. Two farms per Sapper :) I ran in and
took out some farms and Ogres. In this Picture was Steve's reaction.
<br clear=left><p>

I kept whipping out the Sappers. The next trip, I took both of his
barracks with 2 sappers. I then sent in four and took his Stronghold :)
He was like "Shit!" hahaha. So that was all it took to take Steve on
Spiral. I'm not sure If I even made an Ogre mound.<p>

<img src="/homes/csu/1995/fraizer/www/war/STEVEsteve8.jpg" align=left> 
Here is a shot of his island (white), after my first sapper attack. He
was short some farms and guys after that. As you can see he has 2 farms
side by side up top. Below that are 2 barracks side by side and the big
Square is his Stronghold. You can also see he has a mine up top.
<br clear=left>

<img src="/homes/csu/1995/fraizer/www/war/STEVEsteve4.jpg" align=left> 
Well this is what his town looked like before he quit. You will notice
he is short a mine, those two barracks, farms and Stronghold :)
<br clear=left><p>

Steve got one kill for that game. The peon he hit with his Destroyer :)

<hr size=2 width=90%><p>

Steve was asking to be my partner after this. I was like no
way. I'm not getting stuck with anyone building Destroyers and Towers by the 
Sea :) I decided to be nice and said: maybe later.
Steve then informed me that I had found his weakness, Water! hahahahhaha.
So I said we can go land after this. I wanted Mine the Center so I
wouldn't have to look too hard. Steve wanted Garden of War, typical
newbie. :) So I agreed. He quit to chatroom. I was like NOOOOO. He quit
to chatroom before I got a picture of the stats. So I told him on Kali
we always surrender because people like to see the stats.
<p>

So we went on Garden of War on low resources. I was purple for the
millionth time. So I walked up to the mine left of middle. I threw up my
hall.<p>

<img src="/homes/csu/1995/fraizer/www/war/STEVEsteve3.jpg" align=left> 
In the meantime, Steve(Defiant) told me how long he has been playing
war 2. as seen in this picture. hahah. Well actually he was telling me
how long he was on Kali, same thing. 
<br clear=left><p>

Well I got two barracks up and sent out the Grunts looking for his town.
I check all the spots and with my luck, the last one was him. He was in
yellow. I ran in his town. He had 3 grunts and I had 3. I think I was
level 2 by that time and he was level 1 of course :) I ran past his guys
and tried to kill some peons. I'm not sure how many I killed, probably
none. I didn't even watch my grunts so he easily killed them.<p>

Steve was like "Grunt Rush huh". His words were something like that. I said
no "Grunt Rush means Barracks first", and who would go barracks first on
Low?<p> 

So I sent up all my grunts to his town. By that time, 
I was sending up the level 3 Ogres. I also sent a peon up to build a
barracks outside his town. I began sending in my Ogres. Level 4 or so by
that time. He was up to Stronghold and was just building his Blacksmith!
So I started beating on it. He kept attacking with peons and a few level 1
Grunts.<p>

<img src="/homes/csu/1995/fraizer/www/war/STEVEsteve2.jpg" align=left> 
As you can see I met with fierce resistance :)
<br clear=left><p>

I started building towers outside his town but before I could upgrade
them, he surrendered.<p>

<img src="/homes/csu/1995/fraizer/www/war/STEVEsteve1.jpg" align=left> 
As you can see he got a few more kills this time. look at the Gold!
<br clear=left><p>

Since Steve showed up, wasn't an ass or crybaby and was pretty nice
through the whole thing, I decided to ditch my copies of his strategy
guide if you can call it that :)<p>

Longsword then wanted a shot at Steve. He thrashed him too. I think a
few more people did too after that. Haha. It was beat up on Defense man,
you should have been there :)<p>
