Gotcha and I joined a game. Harrier was serving it. He started saying
Shlonglor and Gotcha, you guys are legends! That was so funny.
Well he made the mistake of picking high resources. This was a non patch
game. I got a second town hall instantly. I was producing so much stuff
it was unbelievable. When you got high resources, there is no reason not
to. <p>

Anyway Gotcha decided to go block skyking or skyderz or skysomeone, I
forgot his name, into his town. If you block that one entrance, black is
stuck.  Gotcha built his lumber mill and barracks. I easily
took care of Harrier. Gotcha spent the whole time on Skywhoever. It
was a very easy game but what made it cool was what Gotcha did to
Skywhoever. These three pictures tell the whole story.<p>

Gotcha sent a few peons over to blacks town. I think he put up
these two towers then upgraded them at the same time. Gotcha built this
wall here. When Skywhoever saw gotcha, he sent his footman to attack.
Gotcha quickly filled the hole up with that farm you see building there.
The towers quickly took out sky's footman. You can see their dead
bodies. Sky started repairing his barracks. hahaha. You never repair
stuff you have no chance of saving :)

When Gotcha's peon got done building the farm, he popped out inside the
wall. Sky gave up repairing the barracks. Gotcha used his peon and tower
to take down the barracks.

Gotcha rolled in a catapult from his home town. He built a barracks
inside the wall in. He built those 2 archers and footman you see. He
also built that 3rd tower. I think that was all it took to take
Skywhoever out. It was so funny. He couldn't leave his village.
It was perfect. I was laughing so hard. They guy never got a chance to
do anything at all. muhahahaha.
