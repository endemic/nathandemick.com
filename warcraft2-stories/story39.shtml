Gotcha and I decided to take on 6 players allied on Garden of war. The first
two games we lost really bad. We asked for a rematch. We lost again,
this time worse. It was all Gotcha's fault. We could have won.
So we were getting real mad. We knew we could take
these punks out. So they gave us another rematch.<p>

It was a game using the patch. Garden of War. We figured the only
possible way to win was to build in the middle and take all those
mines. I was orange and Gotcha was white. Gotcha
and I walked to the middle of Garden of War. We both built our halls in
the middle. Gotcha built up top and me on the bottom. I went farm, farm,
farm, Barracks. Gotcha decided to be the tower builder. He put up his
lumber mill 3rd. He had got a few towers. <p>

Gotcha walled in his towers with farms. When the first attack came, I
had 3 Grunts. With the towers as back up, they were easily killed. I got
my blacksmith up quick. I got another barracks. Gotcha put towers all
around the middle. He had them walled in too. When the next attack came
in I was level 3 to their level 1. I had a ton of grunts. With the
towers as back up, they went DOWN.<p>

The idiots kept using a bunch of axethrowers with their grunts. My huge
number of grunts and Gotcha's towers took them down easily. Finally they
wised up and decided to bring in the catapults. But they sure didn't
protect them. I sent my grunts on them and I would run right back to the
safety of the towers.<p>

About the time we were going to Stronghold and Keep aqua sent a Gryphon.
Luckily we had all those towers. I decided if Aqua had gryphons, he
probably had no ground forces. I sent all my troops to aqua's town. I took out
his guys and started killing peasants. He had some towers so my guys
eventually died.<p>

Those idiots never seemed to coordinate their attacks. If they did, I'm
sure we would have died. I had 3 barracks going. I had a ton of grunts.
If you have ever tried to protect the middle, it's impossible. They
would attack from all sides. I would have to keep moving my grunts
around to protect from attacks.<p>

I finally started pumping out the ogres. I had upgraded to Berzerkers
and had all the upgrades but sight and regeneration. I had a ton of
Ogres. Yellow decided to mount a huge attack. He had a ton of Ogres.
With the towers and my Ogres, we took out his attack. Then we decided to
mount a joint attack on Aqua again. We got rid of his Castle and towers
and everything. Just then Blue came in with a ton of level 5 Knights to
save Aqua. Purple came in too. By that time Gotcha had the mages and a
ton of knights. We were able to fight off the attacks.<p>

I got up to Fortress and whipped out the Bloodlust. I went in on Yellow.
I took out Yellow easy.
Yellow was mining about 150 miles away from his hall. 
Yellow was in yellow's spot. He was mining all the way to the mine below
yellow's spot which is about 1/2 the length of the map. I'm not sure why
he just didn't build a hall down there. I don't know what he was thinking. 
Newbie!<p>

Red decided to be just Dragon guy. He kept sending in the Dragons. I
noticed he was trying to take the mine just below the middle on the
right. I sent in the Berzerkers and Ogres. I set up a tower by his hall
and started killing the peons. He sent in all his dragons and forces. He
went DOWN. I've never seen that many peons mining before. Way more than
I've ever had. He was rolling in the money.<p>

Just then Yellow tried to start stealing gold from Gotcha's mine. He set
up a hall right outside the middle. He had peons running right through
our towers to mine gold. I guess blue was hurting for gold too because
he started trying to steal gold too. I'm not sure why. There was a few
free mines around.<p>

Just then black decided to come in. Black! We forgot he was even around.
He had crap. A few Grunts and some Berzerkers. I'm not sure why he
decided to wait that long. Come on! Grunts vs Bloodlusted Ogres?
Well we easily fought off Black. By that time, Gotcha was taking out
Purple. I was taking out Yellow. That left Blue, Red and Black. Aqua was
pretty much eliminated.<p>

I had some much money, 40k?, I decided to get Berzerker sight, and
regeneration. Why not? I had a bunch of Berzerkers to heal. We decided
to go in on black. Black was a total loser. He had his town hall
SOOOOOOOOOOOO far away from his mine. That put him far behind the whole
game. It was about 45 minutes into the game and he was just getting to
stronghold. Well Gotcha just blizzarded his whole place. Black must have
had 50+ peons mining.<p>

That left Red and Blue. They didn't have a second mine so it was easy to
kill them. Gotcha had about 20 mages. He took out all their places. Then
I would send in about 20 Bloodlusted Ogres and about 15 Berzerkers. Their
places went down so easy.<p>

We finished off Red last. Finally he and black were eliminated! What a
game! 3rd times the charm eh? The stats were incredible. Gotcha and I
had about 500 kills together to about a few hundred of theirs. We mined
way more than them. They wanted a rematch but we decided to deny them.
<p>

I didn't get a chance to take a picture of the stats. I forgot. DOH!<p>

<b>P.S. These were all computer players :)</b><p>

The point of this story was to be humorous. I bet you thought those
players were real. haha.
