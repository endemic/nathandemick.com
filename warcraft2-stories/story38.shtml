Two Complete ASSHOLES:<p>

  Well, i was looking to play a good game of wc2, me(Mordavian), 
Durandal, and someones name i forgot, played plains of snow, it was a 
good game but finally i lost to Durandal. Since i was a nice i told 
Durandal "good game" and then we joined a new game on high seas. It was 
a 5 player game but 2 people dropped, then me and Yellow started to 
fight but then he dropped, that left me and Durandal and finally i beat 
him.<p> 

  About this time me and Durandal started talking and i found out he 
was pretty cool so in the next game we joined we decided to be 
partners, the map was spiral on medium, our enemies where {TaiwanJK}, 
and Rabsomthing (im not sure what his name was..).{TaiwanJK} kept 
fucking with the speed, i fucked up and built my shipyard in a crappy 
place. They sea grunt rushed and kicked our asses, it pissed me off, 
but hell, it wasnt cheating. They managed to kill me and Durandal. 
After the game we went back to the 
chatroom, {TaiwanJK} and Rab started to say shit like "You SUCK" and 
"you guys are morons". THAT pissed me off, just cause we lost dont mean 
we gotta be treated like idiots.<p>

  So we agreed to a rematch, same map, same everything. But AGAIN they 
beat us, i guess i just really suck at that map, i would be building my 
barracks as 5 footmen came in to kick my ass. We did alot better this 
time but we lost.<p>

  Ok, now i wanted revenge BAD, since {TaiwanJK} was the biggest 
asshole in the bunch i challenged him at Plains of Snow with medium 
resources, i was Orange and he was Black.<p>

  I decided to make a barracks super early but he beat me to it and in 
came some grunts, but i made some footmen and finished them off, but he 
killed a few peasants. Finally i started to pump out footmen, but he 
would invade with the same number of grunts. It was a stalemate.
  <p>
  Well i found that he had his barracks really close to my town, i 
tried to destroy it but i couldnt out number his grunts, i walled in my 
peasants and started to replace the 7 or so he killed. then i made a 
blacksmith and started to upgrade my footmen. We battled back and forth 
for a long time with footmen. He Built a tower in my town and walled it 
in, that fucked me over so bad. Then my mine ran out so i chopped my 
peasants out and moved 4 of them to purples mine, i had like 2 half 
dead footmen and 4 peasants now. I built a new townhall and started to 
pump out the peasants then i rebuilt my 2 barracks that had been 
destroyed. He tried to attack but i fended him off.
<p>
  About this time he started to say shit like "damn its late" and "i 
got school tomorrow". *WHAT AN ASSHOLE*, he talked all this shit and 
NOW he has to go? I said "no we are finishing this game". Well he didnt 
quit. I made like 9 footmen and invaded his town, he had nothin except 
a few peons, i went north a bit and killed his barracks and then i took 
out his stronghold. After the long stalemate i had defeated him.
<p>
  After that game i went to Kchat and there he was. I said "i thought 
ya had school?" and then he just started to call me a "moron". I knew 
then that this guy was pathetic, and not worth my time. 
<p>
  {TaiwanJK} is good at war2, i dont know if he made his barracks first 
or not, i dont really care. I beat him 1 on 1 and thats all i give a 
shit about. 
<p>
-if you look at the stats you will see he had more kills then me, thats 
cause he slaughterd all but 4 of my peasants, most of my kills where 
his grunts.

Have you ever played with TaiwanJK?<p>  

I took a break from my monkey paper
around 3:30, and got into a 4x4 with him.  Me, Dirga, Durandal, and some
guy named DeathBringer.  Dirga got Purple's spot, so he was screwed. 
Anyways...one of JK's partner's drop early, but of couse he doesn't say
anything.  Then...I walk in early with a bunch of level 2 grunts and he
only has 3 level 1.  So I get in there and trash all his peons before he 
finally gets rid of me.  So he's pretty much out (only a matter of time).
<p>

I could've finished it myself, but I told people to come help, so 
Duranadal helped me end it.  Now...JK only has farms left, so he is 0 
help to his team.  But instead of being cool, and dropping out like Dirga 
asked him to, he just said, "Dirga, Shut up."  "You suck anyways."  
Yeah...Dirga sucks so hard.  Whatever.
<p> 

Then he keeps whining about how unfair it is (funny, it wasn't unfair 
when he was still alive).  And how we should all just restart.  His other 
two teammates, Zuxius and Mordavian would've gone down, we controlled the 
whole board except for the bottem right corner.  Zuxius was about to go 
down, but Mord was in good shape.<p>

JK keeps calling Mordavian a moron for wanting to stay in it.  Last time 
I checked, War2 is about fun, not about winning only.  I finally get sick 
of JK, and send 9 bloodlusted ogres to eliminate his punk ass.  I think 
he realized that, and he somehow got Zuxius to quit to chatroom!!
<p>

Bullshit!<P>

Anyways...I just told JK that he sucks because he lost to 6 grunts.  He 
just told me to shut up.  But at this point, all I typed was, "I have 
better things to do than to play with losers"  And I took off.
<p>

JK is probably burning for revenge, but I will NEVER play his whining ass 
again.  He's just gonna have to stew about how I beat him with 6 grunts.
<P>

I just wanted to play. When one of our allies dropped i knew it was all 
over. I didnt care though, i figured if we were going down we might as 
well go down fighting.<p>

  Like 15 minutes into the game Taiwan started to bitch about how he 
was getting his ass kicked, he was like on the other side of them map 
though so i couldnt get to him in time,also me and Zuxius joint 
attacked Dirga who had control of the center we with his ogres and my 
ballista and a few footmen we did a good job of hurting Dirga, but 
Vermeers Ogres and Durandals Knights came to the rescue.<P>

   Anyways Taiwan goes down. That leaves me and Zuxius, i dont even 
think Zuxius had bloodlust so he was getting rocked. I had about 8 
mages and maybe 15 paladins so i was ok, i fended off attacks from 
Durandal and Deathbringer. I helped Zuxius fend off a few attacks. I 
also had a 2nd mine so i had a good gold supply.<p>

  Dont get me wrong i KNEW i was a dead man, but why should i quit?
I was having fun, isnt that the point of the game? 
  To sum it all up Zuxius quit to the chatroom and we all got pissed at 
each other and left.<p>
