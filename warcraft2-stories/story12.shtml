Partner of the year award goes to THIS GUY. This guy I played with as
a teammate in a 2-on-2.  In the chatroom all he did was bitch about how he
didn't want to play teams because he "didn't want to have to save other
people's asses".  So I volunteer to be his teammate, promising not to ask
him to save my ass, would you believe.  He reluctantly agrees.  Anyway,
midway through the game, he tells me how the other guys suck and how he's
going to take them.  I did a little exploring above me and ran into enemy
number one, who had a good amount of knights.  I tell my teammate about this and
he says "Knights don't scare him."  Anyway, I kill off a bunch of those
knights to take over a gold mine and everything is going swimmingly until
I see 15+ orange and blue knights come after my helpless 6 ogres.  Now I'm
in trouble, but I couldn't ask for help, remember?  Turns out it wouldn't
have made a difference.  I sent my flying machine over my "ally's" base, only
to see three rows of towers blocking him in.  No army units whatsoever except for
five gryphons. That's all.<p>  

I thought, hey, maybe our enemies were strong
and killed all of his guys... nope.  End game statistics showed that my
teammate
had 17 units -- for the whole game!  While I was struggling to survive,
this guy mined out his only mine and had only 12 peons and 5 gryphons to
show for it!  I build more peons in three minutes! And the worst thing was
that he kept talking smack about the other guys the whole game!  He kept
telling me during the game that they "didn't dare attack him" the only
reason they didn't attack him was because they knew that three mages and
maybe a few archers would have him dead in two minutes.  So they
concentrated all their attacks on me.  As Chainsaw would say, "What a
worthless human being."<p>
