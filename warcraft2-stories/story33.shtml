I just finished the funniest game ever!  Here is a simple
little desparation strategy which saved me for quite awhile.
I don't think this strategy will work on real good players, but
the ones I were playing with today seemed pretty good and they
didn't even catch my little trick.  My first town was completely
destroyed, but I managed to save a couple of peons to hide and
run and build a town in another city where a player had been dropped.
I figured that because of my resource situation there was no way I would 
have been
able to make a big comeback and win. So I decided to get creative!
<p>

One thing that I have noticed when buildings are burning and 
they get to the red zone on HP's.  The flames get really big!  Big 
enough that it nearly covers all your colors on buildings if you don't
really look closely.  Its easy to miss if you were flying over in 
a machine to do some quick recon.  Mostly when you see the other players
buildings that had been dropped.  So I took my own buildings and started 
attacking them until I got them to the red zone.  It was so cool!
They even had men walking around in the city and didn't even notice!
I would build my men hide them so it didn't look like any production
was happening.  The thing that killed me is that I didn't have enough
gold to keep strong.  After awhile they finally caught on what
was happening.  I lost, but was still in the game for a lot longer
and managed to shed some blood before I was destroyed.<p>
