Me and my partner were just hanging out in kchat when we decided to smurf 
some smurf.  He said that he was going to be FatSmurf, so I naturally 
decided to be ThinSmurf.  So we served a game and waited to see who was 
going to show up.<p>

It turned out Osric and this other guy (I can't remember his name) 
appeared.  Beforehand, FatSmurf said that he wanted to try out 
invisibility, so he was going to try and win with just invisible mages 
and Blizzard.  I said that I was going to win with air power only.  We 
played Garden of War, I was yellow, FatSmurf was White, Osric was Red, 
and the other guy was purple.<p>

So we are building up happily when all of a sudden the other guy drops.  
Leaving me, FatSmurf, and Osric.  FatSmurf decided at that point to just 
hang out and watch.  So he built 10 flying machines and setup cameras 
everywhere, just like TV.  haha.<p>

At this point, I have started about 4 Dragon roosts and am pumping out 
the Dragons.  I had a couple zepplins flying around and noticed that 
Osric really didn't have too much.  He had a couple of towers and some 
ground troops, but nothing that would stop a huge attack of Dragons.  So 
I started sending them in.<p>

After he repelled my first assault, he sent a zeppelin over my base and 
probably noticed that I had 0 guys and 4 Dragon roosts.  Next thing I 
noticed, he has started pumping out archers and is making lots of towers.
<p>
Well...for the time being all those towers and archers were enough to 
protect his normal base, but he was short on gold.  So I noticed he was 
trying to expand to blue.  Well...as everyone knows, you can't really 
build and upgrade towers when you are getting attacked by a ton of 
Dragons...so his base eventually went down.
<p>
FatSmurf at this point is telling me all about how he is slaughtering his 
own guys.  I guess he was having a lot of fun killing himself.  I had 
told him to kill off all of purple's buildings, but I guess that wasn't 
enough fun for him.
<p>
After I killed Osric's 2nd base, I guess he decided to pump out some 
Death Knights with death and decay.  That was a problem, because the game 
had a decent amount of lag, which means when he Death and Decays my 
Dragons, it takes forever to move them out of the way.  So he ended up 
killing more Dragons than usual.  
<p>
But I had the advantage, I had control of extra mines.  I had expanded to 
the mine below me and had mines going in the center too.  So even though 
Dragons are ridiculously expensive, I had enough money to keep my 4 roosts 
going full blast.
<p>
At this point, I saw that Osric was trying to expand to black.  He 
already had a town hall, some barracks, about 3 or 4 archers, and some 
peons mining.  But no towers, I guess he was short on resources or 
something.  Well...I sent over about 15 dragons and took care of that.  I 
know Dragons are pretty sucky, but 15 of them can do a lot of damage 
really fast.  It was pretty funny seeing his town hall almost entirely 
surrounded by Dragons blasting away.
<p>
Well...after that, it pretty much boiled down to cleanup.  He didn't have 
any resources, and after a bit of trouble, I hunted down his last couple 
Death Knights.  Then I sent in masses of Dragons to finally kill off his 
guard towers.  Osric kept asking who I was, but I decided to keep him 
happily in the dark.
<p>
To this day, he doesn't know.  I'll give him a hint.  No...neither of us 
was Shlonglor.  :)
