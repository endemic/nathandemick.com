We got a 4on4 game going on FOC Low. It was Me, ~Creed~, ~Warangel~, and
StormShadow vs Kyp, EEKman, Shaf and PiCaboo.<P>

I got Orange, Stormshadow Blue, EEK Aqua, Shaf Purple, Kyp Red, Warangel Black,
Creed got White, and Picaboo got Yellow.<P>

Well if you've never played with the ~coolguys~ before, they got some
dorky sea plan. They tell me it's the plan all the leaguers use. What
they do is bipass Juggs and Grunts and head straight to keep and
subs. But the time you got your 2nd or so Juggs, they got Subs on you.
After the Subs, they either follow it up with Knight invasions or
Mages. They got their orders all worked out. So I decided since none
of them were going sea, I would go mages. I got some pretty
Guard towers up, and went straight up to keep. I made 3 Transports
and hid them good :)<P>

I had about 4 Knights by the time the enemy Jugg Armada was beating
on my foundry. I put them in a trans and at the same time Storm was killing
all EEK's peons on Aqua, I invaded too from the left. The problem was
that EEK had 2 guard towers up. Just none near his peons ;) So
I saw I couldn't get the towers so I got all his wood peons. I had
two catapults training. I sent over 2 of them and a Knight or two
to EEKs. Storm was beating away on his hall. I was able to get the 
two towers with the cats. One died somehow, not sure how. EEK continued
to produce grunts while I was wacking on his barracks. He was about
to beat my catapult down to about 6 hit points. Luckily, he ran
outta money for grunts before that thing died :)<P>

During this time Creed had secured Picaboo's island. I grabbed some
Knights and headed over to Shaf's I made it at the same time Creed
was beating on his hall. I think both him and Warangel had their
subs out, trying to do some damage. The enemy had a billion Juggs out.
<P>

Creed and I were able to take Shaf's island with about 4500 left.
I only had 1 knight survive the invasion. Shaf kept picking them off
with Juggs, doing nasty hit and run stuff with peons to lure them in
when I wasn't watching.<P>

Well you would think the game was going in our favor. 3 Islands down.
I took a look over at black's island, Kyp and saw like 5 knights. Crap.
I had a trans full of Knights and one sapper off his shore. He had 3
Guard towers, none walled in. So I figured I couldn't take him
with one Transload. So they layed in wait. D-Day baby. I got another
trans full of Knights and 2 Cats. You're wondering how I can go
about my merry way on the sea while they have like 25 Juggs and
destroyers? Don't ask me, poor playing ability on their part. They
had flyers. I was able to take odd routes with my transports and
bypass the Juggs.<P>

I D-Dayed on Kyps Island. I sappered his tower. But there were
no Knights to meet me. What happened with them all? Who knows.
He sent in some peons to attack me. I used my Cats on his tower and
I ended up owning his island with 10+ Knights and 2 Cats left.<P>

Well that's it right? We got all the islands. Storm took EEKman's,
Creed took Picaboos. Shaf's had 4.5k left. But no, they had
25+ Juggs. Holy crapparoo. Tons of Juggs. They had Destroyers too.
So what were we to do? We could never make THAT many Juggs.<P>

Storm went up to Mages, and Creed and Warangel made a bunch of Gryphons.
They had Storm get healing. For about 45 mins it seemed like, Creed
and Warangel picked off Destroyers and Juggs with their Gryphons.
They would hit, run back to storm and get healed. I saw about
6 or more of them hovering over Storm's new town. As the game
went all, I kept here crap I lost one. Then I hear creed go, ok
Angel, don't lose this one. A few minutes later I hear them yell
noooooooooooooooooo. They had lost the last bird. I didn't think
they were serious. They lost all those birds with healing? I mean
there were plenty of destroyers but I figured that wouldn't happen.
Angel said it was lag.<P>

We were hurting. No more Gryphons. I had ferried over the 4500 from
Shaf's mine. I had no yard, or foundry but I had plenty of oil.
They were telling me to make 3 Juggs with my money. Creed said make
4 Subs. So I made 4 subs. They had flyers, well EEKman had one
for sure. PicaBoo had quit just a little bit ago.<P>

During this time, I was ferrying my troops around to all the islands,
avoiding the Jugg Fleets. I had elminated all the buildings on
all the islands. The enemy were making a stand below Aqua and above
White. They had all their ships there as they had done once they saw
all the Gryphons and lost their towns.<P>

Angel and Creed, with Storm's healing had got their army down
to 1 half dead Jugg and 3 Destroyers. They were all on stand ground.
So I sent over my Sub fleet. If they had any flyers, I was dead.
I snuck up on the Jugg and sank it. In an instant I nailed the 3 Destroyers
too. And all at the same time:<P>

"Shaf was eliminated," "EEkman was eliminated", "Kyp was eliminated"<P>

hahahahhaha. Before they knew what happened their arses was sitting
in Kchat thinking WTF! hahaha My team was equally suprised. I had
won the game :)<P>

What was so great about this game was that not only had they been
eliminated all at the same time, but with SUBS. Ah the humilation.
This was also a test wether the ~36th chamer~ no Juggs strat could
go up vs some serious Jugg Pumpas. And we barely pulled it off.
StormShadow said this was a story game, and I think he's right.<P>
