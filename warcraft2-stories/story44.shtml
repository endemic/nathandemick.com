Now that classes are over, I have some more free time on my hands.  So, 
this afternoon, I decided to hang out in Newbie-ville (Central) until my 
friends finish up with their afternoon finals.<p>

Well...to my surprise, I see Gotcha! is hanging out there too.  So after 
chewing the fat for a little while, we decide do something I haven't done 
in a while....Smurf! Gotcha made up his name , and I 
look around my room to see what I should be.  Well...I decided to log in 
as Laundry.<P>

Gotcha! starts a game and the two of us wait to see who shows up.  
It's about now that we decide to try and win this game with only 
archers/axethrowers.  Since archers do more damage normally than 
axethrowers, I decided to switch over to humans for a change.  
Eventually, TigerClaw and (I forget his name) show up.  We pick Mine the 
Center on Medium and the game starts.<P>

Things start off pretty normal.  I am in the upper right, Gotcha! is in
the lower right.  While our halls are building, we joke about how we are
going down "In a blaze of glory" (to quote Gotcha).  We decide to wall in
a couple of towers (arrow of course) before we attack.  I send my first 6
archers down to Gotcha's so we can double up the guy in the lower left. 
But he sends over about 4 level 2 grunts.  5/6 of my guys get killed
before we drive them off.  At this point, I have about 6 more and send
them over to the upper right to check what he has.  Well...he's walled in
with 2 cannon towers so he'll have to wait.<p> 

Around now, we are starting our elven ranger training.  I mass about 9 
more archers and meet up with Gotcha again.  As ranger marksmanship is 
upgrading, we send our army of 18+ archers over to the SW corner.  When 
we get there, he only has about 5 level 4 grunts, and is upgrading to 
stronghold.  Well...our army of archers take him DOWN!.  Archers by 
themselves may to be too tough, but 20 of them, upgraded, can do some 
serious damage.  Buildings were going down left and right.<p>

After we finish off the first guy, we send our army to the north and Mr. 
Cannon Tower.  By this time, we are both fully upgraded and have maybe 30 
guys.  I had 13 or 14, and Gotcha! had at least that many.  Well...by 
now, this guy as a few more cannon towers up.  But that's ok.  Cannon 
towers don't last very long against an army of 30.  We get all our guys 
together outside his base.  I yell, "CHARGE!" and we go in.  We take a few 
losses and then storm the interior of the base.  Once we get in there, he 
only has a couple of level 2 knights and footmen.  Needless to say, he 
goes down.<P>  

That had to be one of the more interesting games I've played in a while.  
I guess the thing I learned from this one, is try not to let your 
opponent mass ridiculously huge numbers of guys.  Even archers can win a 
game by themselves.  The jury is still out on catapults though.  ;)

I watched that game and it was soo cool. I've never seen Archers take
down cannon towers before. It was impressive.<p>

After the game, everyone got together for a group picture.<p>
