<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well when last I left you I had planed to go offline
permently. However, I am here now. So the obvious questions are:
Why did you leave us? , and Where have you been?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="5">Why did you leave us?</font></p>

<p>I left for one main reason, and that was the fact that I was
spending between 6 and 8 hours a day on online stuff, mostly
war2. So I was determined to cut down on this. I wanted to do
more things with my life besides war2 (24-7) . I guess you could
say my habbit was a little out of control, a sort of
war2-a-holic.</p>

<p>All the fame that came with being a war2 legend, also started
to take its toll on me. Even after I was out of the IWL I would
still get a damm lot of email of people asking me to be in my
clan. But clan mail wasn't the only war2 mail that I was getting.
I also held many training sessions for different people on kali
that had some ambition. It was the greatest compliment to me
seeing someone go from being an ok player into one of the best. I
took great pride in making worthy opponets for the war2
community. The only thing was..... I didn't always have the time
to train people, so I felt bad when they asked me to. I had to
start refusing people, there was just too damm many of them....</p>

<p>It seemed that my fame only grew, as did my responsibilities
to my little trainies. It became totally impossible for me even
to come into kchat and hold a single conversation anymore. Here
is how it would go ... ( ==#== indicates person number, <font
color="#FFFF00">yellow = private /msg</font>)</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><em>Jonny* has just entered kchat<br>
</em></font><font color="#00FFFF">==1== hey Jonny <br>
&lt;Jonny*&gt; hey<br>
</font><font color="#FFFF00">==2== Hi Jonny*, can we play a game<br>

</font><font color="#FFFF00">&lt;Jonny*&gt; hold on ...<br>
</font><font color="#00FFFF">==1== yeah exept I was hurting in
the begining after that first rush.<br>
</font><font color="#FFFF00">==3== Jonny I'm positive that I'll
do better this time the training is paying off!!!<br>
==2== well are we going to play or what?! COMMON LES GO!<br>
==4== Hey man wana go 1 on 1? If your good enough? <br>
</font><font color="#00FFFF">&lt;Jonny*&gt; hey guys umm only

</font><font color="#00FFFF">&lt;Jonny*&gt;
arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrg!<br>
</font><font color="#0000FF"><em>Jonny* has left kali chat</em></font></p>

<p>So as you see it really was difficult to hold 2,3,and 4
conversations at once. I know I could of /ignored them or
something, but sometimes there was just too many of them, and
besides I think ignoring is kinda rude :) I had to start using
fake nicks sometimes to get into kchat and have a private
conversation. </p>

<p>Anywayz, like I said before... It was mainly the time
restraints that got to me though. So I made the decission to quit
playing war2, so in order to do that, I would have to go offline.
Looking back on it now, I relize that I was addicted to a point
but also I just had a bad time-managment system going for myself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="5">Where have you been? </font></p>

<p>Oh boy ! ...... the tales I could, and will, tell you all.
It's been a long and lonely journey. I have seen and done great
things since we last talked.......</p>

<p>After I officially retired, I still had a month to go until I
was actually kicked offline by my isp. During that time I went
into hideing and loved it. There was noone to bother me anymore,
just me, myself and I. But then one day it actually hit me.. I
sat down to get online and nothing happened. I was offline :___ (
...........woooooooe is me ...........</p>

<p>Durning the next month I found myself doing more productive
things, but also I found myself watching allot of bad tv late at
night. You see sometimes I dont get off untill around 12am to 4
am , and there isn't allot of things to do at that time....</p>

<p>About the same time my girlfriend had to get online to do a
project for school. But I didn't have my internet so too bad for
her :) also I started to notice that just about every
advertisment for anything had a url adress beside it, but I
couldn't look it up because I didn't have my internet. Well you
get the picture, basically I started to notice how much I used it
for all sorts of things besides games (mostly games though :) I
also caught myself making puds for the first time in my life. A
sign that I was truely board. But I did enjoy making some of
them. </p>

<p>Well I wasn't about to ignore the obvious thing to do ........
I decided that I would go back online!!! I realized that it was
poor time-management rather than war2 that was making me crazy :)
At the time I had been off for about a month or so.</p>

<p>I wasn't about to make the same mistake though and go back to
playing my old nickname, so I decided to do something different
and I started the process that I now call <em>charactoring.</em>
Its little different from <em>smurfing</em>
(invented by Shlonglor). The basic difference is that
charactoring is that when you win ( or lose) you don't tell the
other person who you really are. In fact you kinda forget who you
really were. You start to be a fresh new name. You have to build
the name up. Since Kali has gotten so big that older veterans
don't often play new people allot, I couln't just go into a game
that was created by a veteran. So I had to start out as a nothing
and build the name up to play with the intermediate players and
then build the name up to play with the good players, and then
build the name up so maybe I would get to play one of the old
skhoolers :) It was a fun game that I played with myself. And I
enjoyed it very much. So you might be asking if you ever played
me?! Well your in luck because I will reveal my charactors. </p>

<p>First of all charactoring takes a long time, because you have
to build trust. Its not like smurfing where its short term. And
also I never went back to my true identity for any games at all.
So basically here is how it went... I went offline in late
november of 1996 and was on again before the new year. So I would
say in about 4 months I was able to develope 3 good charactors. </p>

<p>My first charactor that I developed was called (drum roll
please) ..... ... .. <font color="#FFFF00">*retired*</font>
!!! haha, I just called it that because I was retired right? :)
Well that charactor did good and actually got into some games
with Warangel and 2 other old skhoolers, and several times they
made attempts to guess who I really was, and actually did guess
Jonny* one time, but I didn't let on at all. It was kinda funny
cause I devised a pretty much fool proof system. Instead of using
Kali95, I would use Kali for dos :) you see .... dos had seperate
files for the kali nickname and the kchat nickname. ruuhahah! so
I would sign on a really wierd name on kali and then sign on as
*retired* on dos kchat. It was funny, man were people confussed.
However, at the time then only person I told about anything was
Shlonglor. I trusted Shlonglor , and knew he wouldn't tell anyone
who I really was. Besides I really needed someone to talk to,
because although being a war2 legend had it's price to pay ,
being a war2 noone was starting to get lonely. I would have to
put up with all sorts of things, with people who thought they
knew everything! Man I was realy mad at some newbies sometimes. I
felt like saying &quot;Hey! do you know who I am ? I was playing
war2 when you were still in diapers!!! &quot; But instead I had
to restrain myself, so I wouln't blow my cover.</p>

<p>My second charactor was (drum roll again) .. .. ... .... <font
color="#FFFF00">One Bad Orc</font> .. .. .. Man
I spent allot of time on this one, and actually made some friends
that I didn't have before. I started playing with some other
latenighters on st. louis. I though it was neat that I had made
new friends. I guess thats an advantage of charactoring. The fact
that you can make new friends that you wouldn't if you just hung
out in one group of old friends all the time. I think &quot; One
Bad Orc &quot; made it pretty far amongst the war2 world and
actually also picked up some games with some old skhoolers a few
times. *note* games with the old skhoolers were getting harded to
find now because they all became a more <em>tight knit </em>group.</p>

<p>Well I bet you want to hear what my third and final charactor
was right? Well sorry I'm not ready to tell that one away just
yet. hehe sorry to get your hopes up.. All I can say is that he
has done real good in the past and had many games with the old
skhoolers.</p>

<p>Sorry for not telling you that last little thing there, but as
you can see I've been quite busy developing the three charactors.
</p>

<p>I remeber some time during all of this diablo came out, and I
got it, and I played it, and I realized that it could never be
like war2 cheats or no cheats. It was just not as good of a game.
What made diablo great was the fact that it was indorced by
practically all of the old skhoolers. (well at first anyways) So
if your friends are going to play it.... arn't you? haha well not
anymore (trashed it ) . And to quote Forest Gump<em> &quot;And
thats all I got to say about that&quot;</em></p>

<p>Well with all of this behind me now, I want to get back to
being the old Jonny* again. I know war2 probably died for allot
of people, as it did for me, but untill another game comes that
can completely take its place, I wont stop playing it! And the
most noble thing that I think I can do now is just make it more
fun for everyone else too by telling them what I know :) </p>

<p align="center"><em>&quot;and unto the light, Jonny* was taken,
as he rose from his war2 grave&quot; Jonny* 3:14:2</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Jon Williams</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>Jonny*</em></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">p.s. It seems everyone had been
asking me what in the world &quot;Ruuuhahaha&quot; meant :) Well
a long time ago Shlonglor (or someone on his page) coined the
word Muhhahaaha as a title to a story. Well, being the rebel that
I am, I chose to upset the natural ballance of the univerce and
say Ruhahaha instead of Muhahha. It kinda caught on for a few
people. And I still like it, and thats all that matters!! so</font>
<font size="5">Ruhahaha</font> <font size="2">on you :)</font></p>
