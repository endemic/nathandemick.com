I was involved in a team game, I was J. Munky, my teammate was Max and we
were fighting Charley and piggy.
We played garden of war on high. I was aqua, Max was black, Charley was
yellow and piggy was violet.
Max and me exchanged peasants, like we each put one peasant in each others
town so if one town got killed, we would still have a peasant in the others
town. Apparently (sp?) The duo have been reading steve's strategy page,
because they were playing on the defense, not making *any* attacks. :) 
Anyways, later in the game me and max "accidently" left our messages open
for piggy and Charley to read, so I said "lets kill Charley first, I hate
that name" And our ruse worked, because all the enemy forces were protecting
Charley's town. Ha ha!
Of course, me and Max went for piggy's town with some of my level 4 footmen
and level 6 rangers and some of his paladins. We demolished the town!
But then, I discovered that their was a traitor between me and Max, and it
was not me. Max said "Charley has about a million ogres and towers, I'm 
joining up with him!" That little sunuva bitch! He knew it was a team game!
Then he said "I'm also joining him because I know you suck!" That was it!
<p>

I un-allied with Max and it was 2 on one. We killed each others peasants.
But nobody knew that I had 6 gnomish inventors working away on demo squads!
I had a total of 36 dwarven blowing upper guys!
However, Max and Charley also used the same ruse that we used before. Assholes.
They "accidently" left their messages open.
Max said "Move *all* your guys up to my town, and then i'll tell J.munky to
get me" Then Charley said "but wont that leave my town open?"
And Max said "dont worry"
Idiots. Then Max said "come get me, because I dont want to come over there
to kick your ass"
I said back "Here come some of them great Scottish people!" and he said
"what the hell are you talking about?"
I just smiled. :)
I sent some Scots over to his city. No freakin' defenses *at all*.
As I was totally blowing up his city, I said "Love them Scots!".
He was removed from the game by my demo teams, because his peasants couldn't
build anything.
He sucked! Just one stroke!
After Charley saw all of my demo teams he said "want to be allies?"
I said "Ha!"
He was at my mercy. I sent over some Scots, and demolished through a wall of
trees, to find my Scots bearing down on an unguarded city.
I killed all of his peons, some towers and some buildings, including his
only castle.
No more peons! No more castle!
I sent some paladins, Scots and rangers over to his town, and finished him off.
After the game, I said " HAHAHA!! You all suck! I beat every single one of
you! Even when max turned on me!"
Then Max said "stop being an asshole"
What, your telling me not to be an asshole? Ha!<p>
