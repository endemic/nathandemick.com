Gar's Version:<p>

I joined in on castle hoping to play one good game before I hit the hay,
when I saw Shlonglor and Gotcha! hanging around.  I had to play them!  I
ended up teaming with MadDawg and we started a medium resource game on
Fierce Ocean Combat.  I was white, MadDawg yellow, Shlonglor orange, and
Gotcha! green.<p>  

I built up fast and got out my first jugg, after building my
oil rig.  As my second jugg was training, both Shlonglor and Gotcha!
attacked me!  My jugg went down, but killed Gotcha's ship.  My second jugg
popped out and killed Shlonglor's, but he brought in another and beat up
mine.  Now I didn't have enough oil for a new jugg, so I built a transport
and snuck it away as they beat up my shipyard.  I loaded on a peasant and
went to black's island, dropping him there.  I brought back the transport
and shipped a second peasant to red's island, while building a barracks.  My
shipyard, foundry, and oil rig went down, but I managed to rebuild on the
opposite side of my island.  I built a new town hall at black, and a tower
by the gold mine at red, thinking I would use it for protection.  However,
when it finished building, I saw Shlonglor building a town hall there!
Cool, I thought.  I built 3 more, and upgraded all 4 to guard tower.  They
eventually took out that hall, and lasted until he had built  a barracks and
a catapult.  At about this time, MadDawg sent me a message saying he had
control of the seas and I could rebuild my ship stuff.  I couldn't believe
it!  I had 2 juggs and they both died, and he was able to attack and subdue
both players and gain control of the seas.  After getting oil, I was finally
able to make a blacksmith and upgrade to keep.  I upgraded my guys fast and
started whipping out ogres.  Now I came to the invasion phase.
	<p>
        My outpost at black was booming, and I had a barracks and several
farms located there.  I built a shipyard to make transports, and I loaded up
my men.  I tried to land at Shlonglor's original base, but he had a well
placed tower and several grunts.  I landed next with 6 level 4 ogres.  This
time I took out his tower and many peasants.  I also landed ogres at his
outpost at red, and took it out.  At this point, Shlonglor was done, and my
attention turned to Gotcha!, but not before I landed 5 bloodlusted ogres and
a death knight to finish his town.  Next I landed some troops at green's
spot to see my partner already attacking.  I then landed a transport with 2
death knights and 2 ogres on blue's island, where green had his second town.
I death and decayed his peasants and used runes on some troops, and after a
few more landings, took him out with one dragon I had finally made, just for
fun.  This was a great game, because I got lucky with that tower thing, and
also because my partner MadDawg played so good and covered my ass in the
beginning.  If he hadn't controlled the seas, I wouldn't have had that
outpost last.  Thanks MadDawg!

My Version:

Gar's Story lacked what actually happened So here is what happened.
From his story It looks like only 6 ogres took me out but that wasn't
the case.<p>

I got my first Jugg and Gotcha got his. We headed to take out Gar first.
Somehow, Gotcha lost his Battleship. I'm not sure how, I think he got
there before me so it was a 1 on 1 fight. Well that left me
to take out Gar's ship. He got my ship, I think but my next one took him
out. Gotcha sent another ship. Rather than taking the foundry and
heading to MadDawg, Gotcha was set on finishing off Gar's stuff. We saw
that Gar got a transport away, but for some reason we didn't care. We
couldn't have gotten it with Juggs anyway. Well I made two ships and my
plan was to take my 3 level 1-2 Juggs and take out MadDawg. I got there
and Started beating on his stuff. That is when 4 of his Level 3 Juggs
showed up! Man I went Down. For some reason I wasn't scared. I should
have been but I wasn't. I didn't even build more Ships. I don't know why
either. Neither did Gotcha. So the Next time I looked, MadDawg had like
7 level 3 Juggs. Man, we had like 3 between us Gotcha and I. 

Some time around then Gar invaded me. I had maybe 3 grunts and a tower.
I was level 3 and he was level 1. For some reason all my grunts died and
he had like 4 left. It was 4 grunts vs my tower. He got all 4 on the
tower and I had a few peons repairing it. It was funny because the tower
took out all 4 grunts! haha. He should have attacked the peons repairing
it :)<p>

So MadDawg
came and started getting my shipyard and stuff. I was able to escape
with one Jugg. I hid it. I quickly got a transport. I put a peon on it
and headed to Red's spot.I put up a town hall.<p>

It was then I noticed that someone was building a tower between my hall
in the mine. Rather than canceling it, for some reason, I continued
building the hall. I boned everything that game. Well I sent my
transport back, and picked up 2 grunts and a peon. I put them on the
island. By that time, Gar was putting up like 4 towers on Red's island
around my hall! I built a barracks on the island and a tower. Gar's
tower took out mine and I lost my grunts. I got a boatload of Ogres
and when the barracks was done I whipped out a catapult. I took all the
towers. I then Started making Ogres at that spot. I made another
hall and started mining. I also built a Temple for the Death Knights.
<p>
I then went over and noticed that MadDawg was on Red's Island too
building a hall and a tower! So I got my ogres attacking the tower and I
built a tower of my own. The tower finished off the hall. It was then that Gar
invaded with Ogres. I easily took out his 6 Ogres with my tower and my
Ogres. I had a bunch of ogres left. See by Gar's story, it would appear I was 
easily taken out with his first invasion, 
but that is not the case. So then Gar invaded again and all
my Ogres went Down. I had lost the island and my second gold supply.
For some reason, I forgot I still had a transport. I think I might have
had a chance to possibly save my island. Probably not but there was a
chance. DOH. I just misplaced it somewhere. I thought It had gotten
killed.<p>

Around that time or before Gar and Maddawg BOTH invaded my original island. I
was able to kill off all Gar's guys. You think with a double invasion I
would have been easy pickings but I guess not. Eventually I was able
to take out MadDawgs guys on my island too.<p>

So I had my island and nothing else. It was over for me. After a while,
the invasion came with Bloodlust and the whole lot. 
See it took 3 invasions of my original island and 2 + towers and all that
to beat me on my second one. It's nothing like Gar's story. Well
anyway, Gotcha lost his
Castle to MadDawg because he was Aqua and MadDawg owned the sea. So that
was enough to ruin him. He had a second island and was able to fight for
a while and do some damage but not for long. He went down too.<p>

A few things lost the game for us: Letting Gar get that Transport off,
letting Gar get that second island and Red's Island. We let MadDawg take
us 1 on 2 with Ships which should not have happened. I should have
canceled that 2nd hall. I should have invaded myself. We just totally
boned that game. But we did give out quite a fight. I was fighting both
Gar and MadDawg on both of my Islands. And I did a pretty good job too.
Not good enough to prevent them from eventually taking me over or winning
the game but pretty good :)<br>
