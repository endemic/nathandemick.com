<center> <font size=+3 color=red><blink>Silverwolf Loses to Dragons on Jimland!
</font></blink></center><P>

I joined a game With Silverwolf as my partner. It was going to
be me and him vs Orange and Detonator. A SURE thing. Silverdork picked
Jimland. I really really hate Jimland, but I wanted a chance to
kill someone with 1000 mages. So me and Silverdork picked human. They
picked orc. Orcs have 0 chance against humans on Jimland if the
human player is any good. The Humans can exorcise the dks. They
can mage the Ogres to death. Slow them, Poly morph them. They then
can use the Combo of Level 7 Rangers and Paldans to overcome the
bloodlusted Ogres. You're only real worry is runes.<P>

The game got going and I joked, hey lets go Dragons! Silverdork goes
"No way, Dragons always lose on Jimland." hahaha. He said here is
the plan, we sapper into middle and get that mine. "It's all about
the mines" he said. hahahah. Oh man. Does this guy have any clue I wondered?
Jimland isn't at all about the mines. I said: "Have you ever played Jimland
before?" He said "Yeah whole lot of times." So i'm like, then why are
you saying it's about the mines. What are you goign to let them mine 200k-600k
in gold and let the middle mine be the decisive mine? What kind of
plan is that? 
It's about getting over to
them and kicking their ass. There is only one plan on Jimland. You 
BOTH sapper over to one enemy, beat the crap outta him. Then you sapper
over to the other guy and do the same thing. 
I said "I don't want this game to go all night, and that's what
will happen if you make the fight for the middle mine." I said, here is
the plan, we sapper into one of them, BOTH sapper into the same guy and
kill him. So he said ok. I bet he was dumbfounded by my brilliant plan
that everyone but him would already have thought of haha.<P>

Well the game got going, I was quickly up to keep. I started upgrading my
Archers and Knights. I had level 7 Rangers before I had level 5 Knights and
any Knights at all. I got flyers camped over both of the enemies towns.
They were both Orc. YEAH. There was no chance for us to lose ;) I saw
Silverdorks flyers going around. I got up to Castle and started building
tons of Mages/Rangers/Knights. More Mages really then anything else.
Whenever the enemy would fly over, I'd slow their flyer then beat the
crap outta it with my rangers. hahah.<P>

I got out the sapper buildings and started sappering my way to bottom
left, where Detonator was. I was almost sappered into Detonator and
I asked out Silverwhore was doing. I said are you sappered into blue Yet?
He said: "No i'm just building sappers now." WTF! I started yelling
at him. What is going on? I'm already sappered into him and
you're just building sappers??? I mean I was building sappers
outta one building. I was going slow as can be. I coulda been into
him WAY before that. What was this retards problem?<P>

I got sappered into Blue. I started attacking him. I was using mages,
and archers and Rangers. It wasn't going as good as it could because
I was pissed about Silverwhore not being there yet. Me and Detonator
started going back and forth. I asked Silverwolf where he was. I'm
not there yet. My gosh, what a LOSER. How hard it is it take 6 or so sappers
on Jimland, and sapper a path across the map. I kept fighting with Detonator
back and forth. I kept yelling at silverwhore to get the hell down here
and help me. Thats when he said, I can't there are dragons in my town.
I was like SOOOOOOO. I mean I had rows of Mages, with Slow, Polymorph,
I had Rangers. I mean I WANTED them to attack me with Dragons. I was hopeing
they would attack. So I go on attacking Detonator. But it wasn't going
too good because I was so pissed about Silverwhore not being there to
back me up. A while later, I said: "Are you EVER going to come down
here and help me?" He said: "The Dragons are chasing my peons!" hahaha
oh man. I'm sure you've played games before with morons for partners. I know
I have. Just go to St Louis and team with the losers on those servers.
Well thats what this game felt like. Newbie, Loser partner.<P>

I was getting really pissed. I got a flyer and flew over Silverwolf's town.
He was dead. HAHAHAHA. Shit. Even my newbie friend Damian reg numer 90k
can beat Dragons on Jimland and this guy whose been on kali for almost
a year can't beat some Dragons on a map that's practically Glittering Prizes?
hahahah. LOSER.<P>

I was really pissed at him. I started cussing Silverwhore out. It was then
that he started saying I should have come up and help him. hahahah. Ok
imagine this folks. I'm bottom right, and he is top left. How in the world
was I supposed to help him? I was I supposed to beat up Detonator, then
sapper my way up from Detonator to Silverwhore? hahah. Gee I guess maybe
I could have made a bunch of Dragons and sent my Dragons up to
fight Orange's Dragons. I'm sure that woulda worked. hahah. Does that
reason: "I shoulda come helped him" seem like a logical explanation for
him losing on Jimland? NO. So he said, that I would have been dead had
those Dragons attacked me. Gee. WHATEVER Silverwhore. I'm sure my 30 Mages
with Polymorph, Slow, and my Rangers, and Paladans with healing would have
a hell of a time attacking them dragons. Does this fool even understand how
to fight Dragons? So THEN he said it was my fault for not telling him
that they were going Dragons. Uh, didn't he have flyers too? I know I
saw his flyers at the same time. Is it now my responsiblity to inform
him of people going Dragons. Are Dragons so dangerous on Jimland that
you mush have advanced warning? I guess it's my fault I didn't drive
over to his house and control his flyers and make them see the Dragons.
I guess it's my fault I made him retarded so he didn't know how to fight
them too hahaha.<P>

I was really pissed. I had 40k gold left in the bank, ready to use.
With Silverwhore dead, whats the point in staying. I'm sure I had
some chance of winning, I mean I had human Mages, TONS of them. I had all
the money, lumber i wanted. And I could have easily sent invisible
Mages into his town all I wanted. But what's the point? 2on1 on Jimland.
Thats not fun at all. So I said: "because my teammate is a cock sucking
newbie who goes down to Dragons, I'm going to have to Surrender"
So I left the game. Orange wants it mentioned that it was HIS Dragons
that killed Silverwhore :)<P>

A day or so later Silverwhore tried to say its because he was having
farm problems. Farm problems on Jimland. He tried to say that it
the top left position's fault. He said the walls were in the way. Yeah
WHATEVER. I've played top left plenty of times and never had the problems
he's describing. Can you say Excuse Meister?<P>
 
<hr size=2 width=90%>
<font color=00cc66><b>Here is Orange's Version</b></font><p>

Well, right from the beginning, the teams were Shlonglor and Silverwolf vs. 
Me (Orange) and Detonator. I thought we had no chance of winning, since 
earlier that day, Lemaitre and I had smurfed Detonator on Stl. 1, and I had 
seen the way he played so I figured we were doomed. I decided to go for 
dragons since it was pointless to try and wait till I sappered through to 
one of them, or until they came to me, so I decided to take the quickest route, through the air.  I knew the map, so I knew what mines to take, and since I 
was top right, I decided to go for the 12:00 mine, and not the 3:00 mine, 
and it worked out even better then I thought because Silverwolf was sapping 
down to Detonator, which was bottom left, so I had no opposition. I got 
my flyers up fairly quickly, Shlonglor had his up before me, not sure 
about Silverwolf, but I think he did. I started training archers, and 
upgrading them, which was the logical thing to do, because there was no 
need to worry about knights coming into my town, at least not that early. 
So, once I got my flyers up, I went over to both towns, and I wanted to 
take Shlonglor out first, personal grudge for when he whooped my ass 
Our plan was to double team him, but since I was going for dragons, it 
didn't seem too good for because, because he had one walled in gurad 
tower, and quite a few archers, at least at first, and he was 
making mages. So, I put up 4 roosts right away, and checked 
Silverwolf out. I went to his town, and saw nothing really. He was at 
castle, and had one mage tower, so I was like, shit, he's gonna have mages, 
this might be hard. As I looked around his town, he had 1 level 1 archer, 
and maybe two footmen, that's it. Now what in the hell was he going to do 
with 2 level 1 footmen??? And even more, he tried to hide them from
my dragons, he was putting it in the corner, I havn't figured out why. 
I could not believe what I was seeing, he had absolutely no defense. 
No towers, no archers or mages hidden away, I was wondering what he was 
trying to do. By looking and noticing that he NOTHING, I told Detonator that 
I was going after Silver, and I knew I could take him. Silver played as if 
he had Kali for about 1 week, it was pathetic, I still don't understand 
how he had nothing at all!! Since I was stuipid, and had forgot to make 
farms, and 2 of my roosts wern't done, I only had 2 dragons out, and I 
knew that if I took them to him that second, he would have either gotten 
them, or had time to make a defense against them, so I had to wait to make 4
    more. This was real risky, because if he was smart, he would have 
been making something to defend them, he had a mage tower up for about 
5 minutes, maybe 10, and not one mage. So, I made 4 more dragons, and 
invaded him with 6. I went after his archer, no sweat, and then started 
getting his mage tower. He hadn't even made a mage. By this point, 
I was out of both mines I had, and was chopping to 12:00 while everyone else 
was still working on their second mine. I kept making 4 dragons, and was 
taking eight in at a time. I got all of his stuff, starting with his 
expansion townhall, and I got his mages, barracks, castle, and his mill 
several times. He was being a real pain, and wouldn't die. I got his castle,
and expansion townhall, and then he would go off and make another one, 
upgrade real fast, but, he basically wasted money cuz I trashed it J 
I must give him credit, he was persistant on trying to stay alive, but he 
ended up making another mage tower, and got about one or two mages out, 
which killed some of my birds, but I eventually got everything of his. I 
was starting to run low on gold, because I was making ogres, archers, dk's 
and I had no income, and kept making some dragons, ready to attack Shlonglor. 
I did have about 40k in the bank once my mine ran out, maybe 50k, not 
sure, so I thought I was in good shape, but it ran down to 5k fairly soon. 
As I was about to take twelve dragons to invade Shlonglor ( I thought I
could have taken him, because he only had 3 mages, in his town, 
and couple archers, and one walled in gurad tower, and I did scout his 
town throughly, because I wasn't about to lose my dragons).  I know that
3 mages can take out 12 dragons with ease, but if he isn't expecting them, 
and was busy attackign my ally, then I could have gotten them real fast, 
and gone after his other stuff. I had 12 dragons in the middle of the map, 
so I know he didn't know that they were there, and as I was about to 
take them in, when he messages my ally and I saying that his ally is a 
cock sucking newbie and some other stuff, and that he surrenders.  Hahahaha, 
and to think it would have been that easy! It was actually a fun game, 
would have been better if Shlonglor stuck around. Advice for any of you 
that play Jimland, make something besides peons!<P>

When you want to define someone who sucks really bad at War 2, how do
you define such a person. Well to me, nothing comes closer then defining
it as someone who dies to dragons on Jimland. if you know Jimland, 
you can get mages so quick and without any fear of being attacked. Dragons
cost 2500, mages cost 1200. You should have 2 times the number
of mages as they have Dragons. On top of that, you should have flyers
in their town watching LONG before they even get to castle. On top of
that, it should take 30-40 dragons to die, and maybe more because all you
need is about 4 or so mages to get 20+ dragons. So in reality, there SHOULD
be no way to die to dragons. It would take the worst of newbie or someone
who has absolutely no clue how to play.<P>

That's what is so funny about this. Silverwolf has been playing for a 
YEAR hahahaha. He was my partner this game. I'm sitting there blizzarding
blues, guys going up vs him. When he's crying about lots of dragons in his
town. And I laughed. I didn't think he was serious. I mean come on, who loses
to Dragons when they got mages? And who loses to Dragons when they are
on Jimland. He mades all these excuses. He said he was trying to sapper
to blue. BUT he never made it to blue, I was sappered to blue. So
how come I am able to sapper to blue, AND have mages, but he's not able
to do either? And he tried to say how he wasn't expecting it. He had
flyers he coulda looked. PATHETIC. This should be a lesson to young
and old. Silverwolf sucks.<P>

Now i'm sure you're feeling bad for silverwolf, about me ragging on him but
don't. He's always enjoys sitting there after every game you lose to him
talking about how you had 0 Chance, how there was no way you could beat him.
He won't ever give you any kind of credit, if your teammate sucked or
any other reasons that might explain why he won or why you did poorly.
In fact today, I was playing with Shaf 2on2 Critter attack 2, and I
killed both Silvers and his teammates main island, but Shaf didn't
know he had another mine on his island. DOH. so Silverwolf took that
mine. By the time I found out Silverwolf took the mine, it was all
mined out. I mean how often do you fly over your teammates town to
make sure the enemy isn't on it? I mean doesn't your teammate usually say
hey there are guys on my island? Anyway, it was Shaf's mistake and
I don't blame him for it. Well I DO blame him but I forgive him. Anyway
Because Silverwolf got Shaf's 2nd mine, because Shaf didn't know he had
a 2nd mine, they won the game. And Barely too. But did they give us
any credit for that? NO. Silver tried to make it out how it was
their plan for me to take BOTH their main islands. hahahha. Do you
know ANYONE who allows you to take all their buildings when there
is limited amounts of money on the map as their PLAN? I sure don't.
So that's why this was the ultimate payback. Something to hold up
whenever he gives anyone shit for beating them.<P>

This story reminds me of some other games with Silverwolf. One time he
was my partner. We were playing some moderately skilled people on
spiral. We took them off the sea and what do you think they did next?
Dragons hahah. I had Mages, Rangers all over the place, but guess
who needed help vs Dragons. Our own Silverwhore. Mister I don't know
how to fight Dragons. I said pretty much screw you and let him
die to Gryphons. I mean if he can't do such a simple thing like 
fight Gryphons, then he deserves to die. Eventually I went over and 
saved him but I took my sweet time doing it.<P>

In another game, Silverwolf lost on Spiral low, something he SHOULD be
very experienced at with all his sea games, to some guy who had never
played water before and made destroyers! Silverwhore 

And now to the War 2 whore thing. If you remember, in the Old Schoolers
vs Cases match, 90% of our losses were because Silverwolf lost 5-6 games.
That prompted Unasapper to make that famous phrase: "Silverwolf is
the War 2 Whore giving victories up to anyone." Henceforth, Silverwolf
will be known as The War 2 Whore.<P>

When you see Silverwolf in Kchat, make sure to say: <font color=red><b>

Conversations, people laughing

Silverwolf, Silverwolf,
it's Christmas time for the newbies,
hear cha-ching, newbies sing:
"Silverwolf's giving them away!"

Silver's losing, egos bruising,
jimland sets the scene,
for a disgrace unequalled since Nixon,

Hear the flapping, Silver's crapping,
out to a dragon brigade,
through the derisive laughter you'll hear:

Silverwolf, Silverwolf,
It's Christmas time for the newbies!
hear cha-ching, newbies sing:
"Even I got more than 77k!"
