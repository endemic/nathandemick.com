This had to be one of the more funny stories. Dor had it it out for me for
a while. I had beat him in a 2on2, and 2 1on1s, and he wanted to prove he
could beat me on Sea haha. Well he comes onto Kali drunk as can be. He could
barely type. It was so funny. We played 1on1 on FOC. I was Yellow,
(FOCing Yellow) he was Orange. The pictures pretty much tell it all :)<P>

I made a few Juggs and sent them to the left and above of my Shipyard,
on top of Orange. I see a transport coming, my 2-3 Juggs fire and
it sunk.<P>

It seems he had attempted to rush me, but I killed his transport full of
Juggs. Hahahhaha. Man that was incrible luck, bad luck on his side :)
That's the only time I ever stopped an initial Grunt Invasion with Juggs :)
You can see dor expressing the hoplessness of his situation now ;)

I decided to show him I was ahead by building my mound and first barracks
on HIS island ;)

shore support :)

Man I think the moral is. Don't Drink and Play War 2. After I beat dor,
I think everyone else in Kchat got a piece of him too hahahahha.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+2>Other Games with Dor</font><P>

Don't let dor tell you he could play better when he's not drunk here is
my other games with him :)<P>

Me and Morpheus vs Meddle and Dor. Foc 2on2. Me and Morpho had just beaten
Meddle in a 2on2 where he had a crappy partner and I had stolen his oil.
He was swearing all this crap at me cuz I stole his oil on FOC. It was pretty
funny. Last one to the oil spot is a rotton egg. I wasn't even trying to
steal it either :)

My first 1on1 with Dor on Spiral low. Man I played like crap too. I was doing
my Billion Juggs strategy. I attacked so late that he shoulda had time to
get 2 extra islands before I even got there :)<P>

I headed over to his spot at red on spiral, I was up at aqua, and there is
his "early" invasion coming at me. hahaha. My Juggs nailed the transport. hahaha.
I think the grunts got away but his trans went down.

Now this is how you do it. If they let you kill their buildings you get it
down to the last farm and let peons wack on it. Then when it gets down to
the last few hit points, and they are saying "BYE" you slow the peons and
it takes a LOT longer for the farm to die hahahah. That is a classic Shlonglor
Original. Just when they think it's over you drag it on for a bit longer :)

I had been talking crap about dor. We got into plenty of fights. He thought
he could beat me. So we set up a 1on1 on FOC. and well the stats tell it all.
:)

Don't let this page make you think Dor sucks or anything. He was pretty good
at land and decent on Water. Just not decent enough to beat the Shlonglor!! :)
