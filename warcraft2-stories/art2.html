I'm sure you're thinking nothing happened to Archers and Catapults. But
us professional Warcraft 1 (Yes I do mean 1) players know whats up with
Archers and Catapults. Blizzard messed them up. They in effect voided
their effectiveness and importance in Warcraft 2.<P>

How many of you played Warcraft 1? I'm sure there isn't a whole lot. I'm
sure that a very small percentage of players played Warcraft 1. If you
look back at it now, as I'm sure many have, you think, man this game
sucks. Who would ever play that. Yeah it sucks now, but not back before
War 2. It was AWESOME. But that's not the issue here, it's cats and archers.
<P>

Catapults. First how do they work in Warcraft 2? Well they fire and do
a damage on the area the size of a barracks. The most damage is done
at the very center of the barracks area, while the area surrounding the
center, still within the barracks size, receives splash damage that is
always less than the center area.<P>

How did they work in War 1? Well they did damage apon the same area,
a barracks size, but all the damage was the same for that area. There
was not really any more damage at the center. Anyone in that barracks
area was instantly killed. Wow. What if you had a block of 9 Knights
or Orc Raidgers? They ALL died in one hit. Wow. Is that power or
What?<P>

There are really 2 things that ruined catapults effectiveness in
War 2. First the area of extreme damage was reduced to a 1x1 area rather
than a 3x3 area. Now Image if you had War 1 cats in War 2. You see
a block of 9 Ogres sitting on the shore. You unload your catapult,
WHAM, there is 9 dead ogres in one shot. Is that power or what? YES.
If we had War 1 catapults in War 2, would you build them? Yes I would
too. I think blizzard really screwed up bad with that decision. I know
they were thinking catapults were too powerful in Warcraft 1. Yeah
they were, they were awesome as they should be. Catapults are supposed
to be scary, they are supposed to be powerful. They aren't in war2.

Why don't Catapults work in War 2? First of all, as mentioned above
the damage is only great at the center of the barracks size. So you
see 9 Ogres sitting there and take a shot at them and only 1 dies while
the rest come and beat up the catapult. You are forced to put blocks
of 9 Ogres around your Catapults to keep them from dying. Is that any
fun? No.<P> 

Next in Warcraft 1, peons couldn't attack. That was something
that always pissed me and everyone else off. You have 40 peons and 1 footmen
attacking you and you couldn't do a thing. ACK. We would have endless
discussions back then about how if the peons have Axes to cut lumber
can't they use them on the enemies? Why can't they attack! I think it
was pretty funny when they could actually attack in war 2. We used
to sit there laughing forever about that when we first got the game.
AHHH it's the peon army. It was just so funny. If you didn't play
War 1, i'm sure you won't appreciate the peon attacking joke as
much as us War 1 players did.<P>

Now back to the catapults. In War 1 since peons couldn't attack, you
could safely have your catapults along with your troops beating up
on the enemy with that barracks size death area. It was GREAT. 
The peons had to sit there staring in awe of your death machine. They
couldn't do a thing but clap and cry :)
<P>
But in War 2, peons can attack. So how many peons do you have? Tons. You
simply take your peons off wood, suicide through the enemy grunts or
Ogres and kill that cat. Then you're safe. Peons are the number 1 Killers
of catapults. I don't think Blizzard really considered this. If they
had, maybe they would have kept that Catapult damage the same as
Warcraft 1. Then catapults wouldn't suck like they do now.
Sure they come in handy occassionally in those strange levels,
like Nowhere and Nowhere 3, and sometimes when you want to want
to go break in someone's wallin who are camping till ogres. Sometimes
you want them on the sea. But overall, catapults are almost worthless.
You could get through your entire War 2 career without ever building
one catapult.<P>

<font color=00cc66><b>Archers</b></font><br>

Now we go onto archers. In Warcraft 1, Archers had much more
damage and range. They also were 1 speed faster than a footmen. This
made for some great and dirty fun. Gotcha the master of dirty and
anoying strategies was the master of archers. Lets say you had
1 footmen and he had two archers. You tell your footmen to attack
1 archer. He would run with that archer while the second archer
beat on your back. If you decided to attack the other archer, he would stop
running with the first archer and use the second one to run. Using this
method there was 0 chance of killing the archers with the archers having
1 speed more. The range and damage really added to that strategy to.
<P>
Archers in War 1 had awesome damage and range. It was something you
see when you fully upgrade Archers to Rangers and +3 damage in War 2.
That or a little more is how effective War 1 orc and human archers
were with only 2 upgrades.
You would set up a row or two of archers and the enemy couldn't get close.
They were all dead before they could get a hit in, and this included
Knights.
<P>

In War 1, you almost always upgraded your archers. You would go for
the blacksmith upgrades and mill upgrades at the same time. You would
progressively upgrade both until they were all at full. Well this is
what I imagine blizzard had in mind. But who upgrades their archers?
Who at the same time they are upgrading the first weapons upgrade heads
over to the mill and clicks on the arrow upgrade? Well no one but
newbies for sure. The problem is archers aren't effective because
they don't have enough range and damage. But they don't have enough
range and damage because no one upgrades them. Kinda leads to a
a recursive problem eh? People don't use archers because A, they get
their asses kicked in 2 seconds by everyone including peons, and B
because they are just too expensive to upgrade.<P>

What happened? Well first, I don't know who was smoking the dope when
they put in Axer Regeneration. The problem with it is the regeneration
is too slow. I'm sure if it were really fast, people would complain
you're some sorta cheater or something so Blizzard put a long timer
in it. The problem was it was two long. It is almost easier to make
a new axer than to wait for the current one to regenerate. Also since
the range and damage sucks so bad, how many axers survive a normal
battle? None really. It's only times against dragons when you have a lot
of Axers and repeat dragon attacks (like in the orc single player campaigns)
that regeneration has any use whatsoever.<P>

Archers can kick as on land in War 2. I'm sure no one would agree there,
but you probably never saw Gotcha use them. Once everyone became lusters,
he dropped using archers in land battles but before he did, wow. He would
beat people with archers on land. Here is how he did it, he played
like back in War 1. He would upgrade both the blacksmith and mill upgrades
at the same time. He would get the 2 offensive, the Ranger, the +3, then
the range. He would then use rows of archers behind his knights. Early
on he would make a few archers to go with his footmen. While the footmen
beat up on the guys up front, the archers in the rear would hack on them.
He would win all kinds of battles he wasn't supposed to. I'd be laughing
at him saying you're going down, and he would win with his archers. The
archers would all take a shot at the same guy, wham he's dead and all
shoot at the next guy.<P>

The enemy had two choices, he could just sit there and take it or go hit
the archers. If he sat there and took it, he would lose because all the
archers could fire on the same guy at once making it just 1 or 2 hits for
the footmen. If the enemy decided ok lets go get those archers, he would
quickly determine which archer the enemy clicked on and run with that 
archer. The other archers would beat on the enemy while his footmen also
beat on the enemies back. It was often more damaging for the enemy
to chase the archers than to just sit there and take it. The enemies
best luck was to have more footman than Gotcha and beat Gotcha's footmen
and then go attack the archers. But this didn't happen all the time. 
Usually the enemy would break through to the archers maybe 1 out of 5 battles.
That's certainly acceptable. See it's because archers train so fast. 
You could always keep the balance off in favor of you and the archers.<P>

Using this method, Gotcha would waste the footmen rushers. People always
hear this story and go, well why not just use that money on footmen
and you could have more footmen and forget archers all together. Well
I really wish you were around back then to get your asses kicked by
Gotcha's archers. He's not around much anymore and doesn't use his
archers anymore so don't ask. The problem with this is it's such
and advanced strategy and it requires the humans that no one ever uses it.
In my whole War 2 career, I have only seen Gotcha effectively use
and win with archers and that was because of his War 1 experience.
<P>
So what happened to Archers in War 2? They were so powerful in War 1 that
I think blizzard tried to downgrade them a little. The only problem is
they downgraded them too much. They made it too hard to use them so no
one uses them. Do yourself a favor, check out the archers in the
War 2 Alpha. they ROCK man. Thats how Blizzard should have made the
archers in War 2. They screwed the pooch on that one.<P>

And with that, BOOM, 2 almost useless units, catapults and archers. It's
a shame that they took the most fun and useful units (other than water elementals) and made them almost unnecessary.
