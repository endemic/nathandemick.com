Here is a great story written by Tou:<p>

Well, after a night of hard fought victories, i felt this had to put 
down in writing.  The situation.  3 on 3, all direct links.  The players: 
Me, Gotcha, and Shlonglor vs Claytonious, Beta, and YingYang.  The 
background.  Clay and YingYang had beaten me and my partner twice in a 
row on first High Seas Combat, and then the Maze.  Me and my partner 
wanted revenge.  Clay and YingYang had also beaten Gotcha and Shlonglor 
twice in a row, High Seas and Garden of War, if I'm not mistaken.  So we 
all knew the competition would be fierce and the battle would be one of 
the most exciting of our war2 careers.  And so it was.  We started off 
with our old favorite, High Seas Combat.  The irony was that this was 
probably the favorite board for all 6 of us.  So we all knew what we were 
doing.  That was the scary thing.  The positioning was odd, going from 
orange's position and continuing clockwise, Beta, YingYang, Gotcha, 
Claytonious, Shlonglor, me.  I got the best position, yellow, so i was 
quite happy.  However, the position made me nervous.. either we had to 
kill clay quick, or else gotcha would be bombarded from both sides.  We 
started off thinking this would be a battleships race, and everyone was 
building mass battleships.  Unfortunately, they took the initiative, and 
Gotcha's shipyard was down for the count, EARLY.  Now came the part where 
shlonglor whines and continually says "we lost, it's over, they got a 
billion juggs".  But, it was not over.  Shlonglor is perhaps one of the 
greatest war2 naval tacticians on kali, and i had a few tricks up my 
sleeve.  We all knew that clay HAD to be knocked out of commission.  
Shlonglor wanted to do it by taking out his shipyard, but i was sure the 
only way to do it was to get directly at his gold supply.  Gotcha 
attempted a 6 footman assault with his last transport, but his transport 
got sunk.  Now shlonglor was positive that we were doomed.  That's when i 
got my damned flying machine.  I flew over to clay's base, and whaddya 
know, absolutely NO ground defense.  The big question was, can i slip in 
a transport.  By now shlonglor had gotten over anxious and kept saying 
"We have to attack NOW", and made me take my 2 miserable level 4 
battleships and follow around his 3.  We knew the enemy had at least 10 
ships between them, so it didn't look to good.  First we took out the 
close by battleships.  This wasn't too hard, we outnumbered them 5 to 3, 
and took em out with minimal damage.  Everyone was watching the 
battleships, so i took this opportunity to disembark my 6 pitiful level 3 
footmen upon clay's shore.  As soon as they got off the boat they ran 
right to clay's peons, and slaughtered every last one of them.  By now 
clay finally got ogres, and managed to take out my footmen, but his gold 
supply was completely slowed down.  We also managed to take out his 
shipyard, foundry, and oil platform.  Now at this point i would have 
retreated and planned out a new attack.  But i forgot, i was allied with 
shlonglor.  "Go up! North! Go go go. Go attack purple".  By now i had 
produced 2 more battleships, and decided to pacify shlonglor's desires.  
So we went in and took out purple's oil and foundry, when we found our 
ships onslaught by death and decay.  We pulled the good old retreat and 
come back in until we finally got his shipyard.  By now, i was thinking, 
okay, we got the advantage, let's consolidate for a while and work on 
domestics.  But NO.  I'm still with shlonglor.  "Okay, go orange go 
orange.  Take out his juggs!".  So, reluctantly, i send my ships north to 
hopefully take out orange.  Of course by now, orange had about 6 or so 
juggs, and they took out my 3 without losing one.  But my shipyards had 
produced 4 more battleships, and i wasn't about to let up now.  II was 
infected with shlongloritis.  One thing that's odd about war2 is that 
units get first strike on defense, unless it's naval, in which case, the 
attacker gets the first shot.  And when you are dealing with fully 
upgraded cannons on the battleships, the first strike means EVERYTHING.  
So, by the grace of god, i destroyed oranges fleet and oranges entire 
shipbuilding operation.  By now, gotcha was back on his feet, and instead 
of bothering with navy, he had a nice little air force.  At the same time, 
Shlonglor decided it was time to put away clay for good, and poor clay, 
who didn't have enough gold, fell easy prey to shlonglor's level 5 ogres 
when his own were only level 2.  Clay was down and out.  Shlonglor 
finally shut up about us having lost.  What happened "next" I'm not 
exactly sure.  I took out purple's second town, which was quite 
undefended as he only had one transport.  I think someone then landed on 
oranges shores and he surrendered pretty quick after that.  Killing 
purple was just a matter of gotcha's gryphon force killing off his death 
knights.  3 on 1, YingYang stood no chance.  I put my leftover level 5 
footmen and some knights on a transport as a token destruction team, and 
YingYang was toast.  Once again proving that: 1) The transport is the 
most dangerous naval unit (or, The transport is mightier than the sword), 
and 2) He who hath the most battleships cannot win unless he group 
them together.  What a fight!  I think at the end shlonglor realized that 
we didn't lose, and that was the best part =).  Thanks for the great game 
clay, beta, and YY.  Maybe next time, eh?<p>

Let me add my own thoughts on the game: Gotcha never loses his shipyard,
so when his went down, I was scared. I looked over on Gotcha's screen
and there was about 5 Juggernaughts attacking him. I only had one and
Tou only had 2. So I was scared. What really made me think I lost the
game was Gotcha had a transport full of 6 footman and it got sunk. 
I was really worried because I was red. As everyone knows, Red's whole town
can be hit from the sea on High Seas. So I knew if we lost the sea, we
would lose. BUT we didn't. About 4 of my ships took out 10+ of theirs. I
was only level 2 too! It was because they didn't control them right.
After that, I invaded Clay with level 5 ogres vs level 2. Tou had
already weakened Clay with his footman attack. So I exterminated Clay.
Gotcha invaded beta. Tou, I think invaded YingYangs new town. After
that, it was easy sailing. A funny thing happened in that game. I had 1
Jugg by YingYang's town attacking him. He hit it with Death and Decay 5
times. Everytime I would run and survive. That Level 2 Jugg made it till the end
and it only had 79 hit points left. That was a great game!<p>
