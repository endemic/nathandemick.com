I don't normally like to flame people, because I like to be a nice guy, but
this really made me mad.<p>

I was on castle, and it was full of people because central was down.  I
was happily playing warcraft 2, smurfing as Ra.  I guess I'll have to stop
smurfing as Ra now that people know who that is.  I got in a game with 3
other players, StrWarsNut, Dumbo, and Marc.  We agree that the teams would
be Marc and myself vs. StrWarsNut and Dumbo.  I was black, dumbo was white,
marc was yellow, Nut was green.  It seemed like all of them were newbies,
esp. when my partner said "I'll do the sea stuff, you take the air?"  I
explained that I'd rather do sea and air (mostly sea), and I started
building.<p>  

     I foundry hopped over to white, intending to build a barracks
there, and guess what?  He had a tower waiting for me!  I stupidly
tried  the barracks anyway.  Oh well, we all make mistakes. So I
build a nice fleet, and am trashing white, killed his foundry, blacksmith,
shipyard, oil rig, and am trashing his keep from the sea.  Nut sends in
subs, and appears to be moving them around.  Either that or I really couldn't
tell where the shots where coming from.  I have a keep finished, and start
quick work on the alchemist.  He gets 2 of my juggs before I take his
subs down.  I go back down to white with 4 or 5 juggs and 2 zepps and 
he quits.  He really shouldn't have, he should have supported his
partner.<p>  

     So Marc says "ok, everyone one for himself?"  Nut says "may the best
man win."  I point out that since I took Dumbo out, I really shouldn't lose
my partner for it, and yes, a 2 on 1 isn't good, but hey, that's why in
a 2 on 2, you take out 1 guy first.  So my fleet (up to about 5 juggs
and 1 destroyer at this point) starts trashing Nut.  I keep sending in
ships, kill his barracks and his replacement barracks and in general,
can tell the game is pretty much over.  I build a dragon or two to hit
his inner buildings.  During this time, Marc is insulting my town, so
I point out that I do in fact have a fleet.  Nut leaves for a second to
get the phone, so I pause the game and tell Marc that it is rather rude
to insult my playing when I haven't seen him do ANYTHING to an enemy.
Those of you who know me know that I don't like to insult other players,
but he was making fun of my playing and hadn't done anything.
<p>
     Then I see Marc bring in 10 griffins.  Great, I
think.  Now we can trash green and get him to quit.  Then EVERY griffin
hits my dragon.  AFTER that, Green quits the game.  Marc was attacking me
without warning when we still had an enemy in the game.<p>

     "Well," I thought.  "He probably still thinks this is that free for all
he asked for, even though I told him it wasn't".  So I ask him what he is
doing.  His griffons keep attacking, changing targets, indicating that he
is getting commands through.  I get really annoyed at him and ask him 
what the heck he is doing.  He doesn't respond.  In disgust, I quit.
Check out the screenshot of the stats.  I was allied with him, and he
attacked me.  And this wasn't one of those Free for all alliances.  This
was a pregame team set up.  He easily outharvested me because I was actually
fighting.  All 6 of those kills were my ships.  People like that make me mad.  
I did a /whois on him in kchat.  He is Marc1, his serial number is 5702.
