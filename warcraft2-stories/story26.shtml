	I have taken to smurfing around a lot recently, cos it's so relaxing to 
whip some newbie without having to think or try very hard (one of the 
funniest things is telling people that I'm 12, then they start telling me 
how to send messages and shit, haha!), but I've run into a bit of a 
problem: everyone else is doing it!  These days if you're going to go 
smurfing on castle you have to be prepared to run up against some other 
real players pretending to be nobodies.  I'm not sure how many times this 
has happened to me so far, occasionally I find myself having to try 
unexpectedly hard, and the stats show that one of the other players must 
have had a lot more practice than they claimed, but I had a brilliant one 
tonight: a 4 player team game with no less than 4 SMURFS!  Yep, all the 
other players were smurfing, I found out afterwards...
<p>
	I was hanging around castle looking for some innocent victims, having 
changed my name to Vagabond, and I joined this game with Bart, Homer and 
JmstSquirt (or something).  It was Plains of Snow, High resources, so it 
really looked like a newbie special.  No one asked for ogre rules 
(disappointing - nothing like building 3 or 4 town halls straight away, 
knowing that you don't have to defend them until ogre time, by when you 
have more money than you know what to do with };), but Bart and Homer were 
both claiming to have bought the game within the last 2 days! so it was 
still pretty convincing.  Take it easy on us! they said.
	<p>
	The game started, me (aqua) and J..Squirt (white) vs Bart (blue) and Homer 
(yellow).  Assuming I was playing newbies, I planned to build town halls 
over both the top 2 mines as early as possible without really bothering to 
defend them.  All went fairly well, and I had both halls up and running, 
totally undefended, by the time my mine ran out.  No interference from 
anyone, good old newbies I thought.  About this time, my alchemist finished 
and I got some flyers going.  Not expecting either of my enemies to be any 
threat, I sent the first one over white to see how my teammate was doing. 
 SHIT!  There's yellow grunts and blue ogres all over the place, and 
streams of blue sappers scampering around blowing shit up.   Newbies? 
 Hmmm...   the next 2 flyers go over the enemy bases and sure enough 
they've both got to fortress not long after me.  Bought the game 2 days ago 
did you?  Fast progress...  Actually, the way my flyer was positioned over 
blue's base, it looked like it was in the middle of a huge city spanning 
both blue and red mines (oh fuck!), but in fact there was hardly anything 
out of the range of sight of the flyer.
<p>
	So, scared shitless, I run all my grunts up to protect my mines, and start 
building extra barracks and churning out the fat boys.  I put another flyer 
over blue's base and see about 4 or more alchemists (!) so I put up an 
extra one myself and send the ogres in to try to eliminate the threat. 
 With the help of a few sappers taking out towers, I make it in and kill 
about 8 lots of sappers just sitting around in his base (whew) and quite a 
few of his ogres, cos I beat him to bloodlust.  I think I got him just as 
he was building up a major assault for me... as a result I never really got 
attacked and my mines emptied without any sign of danger.
	<p>
	All this time I've been thinking my partner's being shitted on, and 
worrying about yellow, but by the time I overrun blue with ogres, dragons 
and deathknights and get down to yellow's base, there's nothing left except 
white palladins!  It only remains to take out blue's annoying dragon roosts 
and clean up.
	<p>
	The stats look pretty convincing, full bars for me :).  Anyway, I join 
kchat afterwards, and there's Vitor saying 'ok, who was vagabond?'  HAHA! 
 The other 2 never owned up, but Vitor reckoned that one of them (probably 
blue) must have been Azure, cos he popped in and out of kchat right after 
the game, without saying anything.  I thought Homer might have been a real 
newbie, as he didn't do too well, but Vitor said that Homer had tried the 
taco trick on him earlier or something, I dunno.
	<p>
	I hope it was Azure, muahahahahah...

About Smurfing: It seems just about everyone on Kali reads these
stories. I never imagined that that many people read the stories. It
seems smurfing has become quite the rage on kali. I got into kchat the
other day with about 10 of my friends ALL under fake names. Kinda
funny.<p>

Back to smurfing, It seems no one gets the point of smurfing. We
invented smurfing because we had a hard time playing new or intermediate
players because our names are too well known. 
They would go you are too good for me to play.
So the point of smurfing
is a really good player goes in a game under a fake name and beats up on
someone that is less skilled. But the person they beat up on are
supposed to believe that that the good player under the fake name sucks. 
Smurfing was originally a
Stormreaver clan deal, Muzzy,Cadaver,Stormshadow,Vermeer, and Warp. But
now on kchat and in war2 it seems everyone is a smurf. It's really
messed. There are newbies out there or players with intermediate playing
abilities playing as smurfs. BUT they arn't the very best at war2 so
they end up playing people that are better then them and they end up
getting beat up. Which makes no sense. Smurfing is Really good players
beating up on crappier ones. So the point is, you better be one of the
best if you go out smurfing or there really is no point. If you are
going to lose, you might as well lose under your real name.<P>
