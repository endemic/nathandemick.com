<center>StormShadow and Vermeer vs. Huevo^ and CosmoKramer^</center><p>

These guys may not even be in IWL yet.  From what I hear, they are trying 
to get in.  So...any clan leaders who get these guy's apps...read this 
first and ask yourself if you still want to have them in your clan.<p>

This story isn't much about good war2 play, it's about horrible 
sportsmanship and jerky behavior.<p>

Me and StormShadow are louging around in kchat, when an IWL challenge 
goes up from Huevo and CosmoKramer.  We accept it, and decide to play 
High Seas Combat on medium.  They instantly start bitching about how 
water sucks, etc.  Anyways...the game goes as expected and Storm and I 
beat them pretty bad.<p>

So...in the name of sportsmanship, we agree to give them a rematch.  So 
they pick Continent to Explore, on High.  Me and Storm must have been 
thinking alike, because we both start typing, "Town Hall first!!!!"  
These two guys agree, and one of them even says, "Yeah...no cheap attacks."
<p>
The game starts, and a minute into it, Storm starts saying, "grunts in my 
town"  I'm thinking they did barracks first, because I went hall, farm, 
barracks, and my barracks wasn't even done yet.<p>  

We both start saying, "what the heck...we agreed!"  And they give us some 
crap about how we did it to them on the last board!  What the heck...we 
played High Seas, on Medium!!!!  Then the start accusing us of being 
cheaters.  Since they killed Storm first, I was able to build up a 
little.  I had about 7 level 3 grunts and sent them out to go check 
around.  When I got to orange, he had 2 farms, a peon, and one barracks.  
No town hall.  Big surprise.  I killed his only peon, so he was 
effectively gone.<p>

I didn't need to go check black, because I knew his base would be the 
same.  The funny thing is...even though they were trashing our bases...we 
still would've won.  We both could've built new town halls, orange was 
gone, and I still had a bunch of level 3 grunts that were about to go 
kill black's only peon.  But rather than stick around and play a 
worthless game, we both left.<p>

If you think that's the end of story...nope.  There's still a little 
more.  Upon re-entering kchat, Storm gets bombarded by /msg's saying "we 
won, we won."  So he /ignores them.  Meanwhile, I hop onto the IWL page 
to tell Cpl Will about this.  While I'm there, I decide to check my 
email.  Imagine my surprise when I see that I have 12 messages from one 
of them all saying, "we won."  Boy...I hope they are proud of themselves.
<p>
I'm not sure if they really did win.  Even if they did...I don't care. 
IWL is a place for fun.  We were playing war2 before it existed, and if it
shut down tomorrow, we'd still be playing.  Try and keep this a fun place
by letting losers like that know that they aren't welcomed here.  I for
one will never play either of those two again.  Even if they are easy
points, and even if they start calling me a wimp, I'm better than that.
