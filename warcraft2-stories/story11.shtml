This is definitely THE coolest map i've played so far on warcraft2 (ok so 
i've only played this map and the default maps, but still...). d/l'd this 
off your homepage yesterday and played a game today in the office, 
2-player game with a friend over the ipx network. to make a short story 
long, here's my account of what happened 
<p>

We were both orcs (first time i was using orcs...influenced by your views 
i guess), he was red and i was...god i've forgotten! heh. but i was 
directly opposite him. so anyways, i'd read the page and i knew that it 
was possible to go around the map on land. my friend (skarsnik) had 
explored the map b4 playing against me, but somehow he failed to notice 
the land passages. hehehehe....<p>

So there he was, approaching it like he was red in high seas combat. yep,
furiously building up his naval force (but i didn't know this then). me, i
built up 2 grunts, and sent them out on a long land journey to make a land
grab for the other mines. after a while, i started up 2 other town halls
at other mines. still didn't have any ships though.  he messaged me asking
me what the hell i was doing (he couldn't see any shipyards) but i ignored
him. then, he invaded me with a rather large force, and barely managed to
kill me off. but by then, i had 2 other thriving towns running by
themselves.<p> 

I sent in my 2 grunts (who had been idling at the edge of his town 
without being noticed) and hit his gold supply. didn't count how many i 
took out, but i know i killed off like 90% of his peons (at least) b4 his 
defence killed my grunts. he was too busy smashing my now-abandoned first 
town.<p>

I had started a town at the mine next to his hometown, and had 2 barracks 
producing there. i sent in another group of grunts and attacked his 
lumber and gold supply. this time, i killed off all his defences and all 
the mining peons. by our guesstimate, i killed maybe 25 of his peons. 
this was the turning point; he was screwed. meanwhile, his zeppelin had 
found my 3rd town (quite weak, my fault) and his invasion force was 
smashing me there, but i managed to sneak 2 peons back to my first town 
and started rebuilding there.<p>

By the time he managed to kill off my invasion force, i was far outmining 
him. i had at least 25, probably 30+ peons in 3 different towns by now; 
he still only had one. his troops then came after another of my towns; he 
killed my town hall, but i managed to save 3 ogres and a peon, and 
somehow he didn't notice my barracks off in the corner. i gathered my 
forces there, built a guard tower, and casted runes in front of the 
barracks while building a cat. he noticed too late, when my cat starting 
hammering his peons and grunts; he lost maybe 10 grunts and 5 peons, i 
didn't lose anything. and i wasn't even paying attention there! the 
computer did all the work.<p>

By now, he realised that i was far ahead in resources. i had 4 towns, all 
with barracks, and i had enough troops in all the towns to defend them 
against anything less than 3 transportloads. he didn't even have enuff 
ground units to FILL 3 transports. he surrendered there and then; turns 
out i had TWICE his number of units, 1.5 times his buildings, and i had 
mined 50k more gold and 15k more lumber than him. i didn't have any oil, 
but i didn't need to.<p>

Best game i had in ages. we only recently discovered your homepage, and 
the stuff in there really opened our eyes to new strategies and new 
tactics. anyway, just wanted to tell you how much fun i had playing this 
pud.<p>

btw, his ogre killed mine on the central island, but he didn't bother 
building a town hall there; bad error.<p>  


great game, great pud. 1.5 hrs well spent.<p>


Thanks to Limabean and Skarsnik for this.
