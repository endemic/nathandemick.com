We got together another crew who thought they could take the andrews
boys on FOC. What resulted was probably one of the 2nd biggest ass kickings in
War 2 History. Number 1 is Andrews boys 7-0 story to be found later. :)<P>

This was so funny, I set some Juggs on Asphalt's hall. He sat there
repairing it with all his might like a newbie. Warp and I were camped
on his shore with Juggs. Gotcha then rolled in with his purple 
transport. He got out of the transport with a Mage, casted a blizzard and then
got back inside. All asphalt's Grunts and Ogre charged the transports and
as you can see, the Juggs slaughterd him. Take a look at that picture. Is
that not the coolest picture you ever have seen? That should get a award.
"Shlonglor for best cameraman"<P>

FlankerX tried to get a 2nd hall on White. I set up a guard tower on the
shore. Flanker saw it and started attacking with peons. But I moved my
Juggs over and protected it. It was so funny. He got that tower down to like 20 hit points but the juggs kept killing his peons at he tried to get the
tower. Man. haha. Too bad I didn't get a picture. I then sent over
some peons and built a hall right in his spot around his farms. haha I had to rub it in. Flanker managed to hide a barracks, some footmen around the corner.
I found him with a flyer and he ran in and killed all my peons. I figured
I didn't need to protected the place because we had killed everything else on the map. So that's why Flanker got 15 kills. haha. I knew he was probably on
that island but I didn't care. Warp was bored and asked where to send all his Bloodlusted Ogres. I told him my 2nd town. He sent int he Lusters and 
wasted the footmen. haha.<P>

Take a look at the stats. Is that the sorriest stats you have ever seen?
I've played newbies who did better :)<P>

 
In contrast, the next picture is stats from a game where Maddawg, Me,
Werm, and Gotcha went down to Lord Helmet, Detonator, Durandal and Tommy.
That game was pretty much an ass kicking but look at those stats in comparison
with the above ones. If you are going to go down, at least go down with
some kills :) Make it look like you had some chance :)<P>
