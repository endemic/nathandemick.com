<title>Shlonglor's War 2 Stories</title>

First game <a href="story60.shtml">
<b>Andrews Boys 2-0.</b></a> I never thought a game could be better, then
came <a href="story66.shtml"><b>
Andrews Boys 6-0.</b></a> I never thought any game could beat that, but
this one did.<P>

We had a series of FOC victories, or should I say FOCing victories. :)
We looked around and picked a team of what we thought would probably be
an easy kill. Gotcha, Shlonglor, Warp, Shaf vs Tarquinn, FlankerX, 
Silverwolf (The War 2 Whore) and Wermacht. I was tired of FOC and 
Gotcha wouldn't play
on any of the cool puds so I picked High Seas Combat.<P>

Gotcha picked humans. I was quite pissed at that. I remember so
many HSC games where Gotcha's Knights get killed by a bunch
of lusted Ogres. But as I would later learn, I'm sure glad
he picked humans :)<P>

I had a plan. Man plan was to steal Red's oil. Last time I was at
red, and Denbert was where I was, at yellow, he stole my oil and I
was screwed. Red is already on the sea, but to not be able to go
sea too, equals dead for him. RED=DEAD is the common phrase for War2.
I figured, Warp, Shaf, and I would go juggs, Gotcha was heading straight up 
to mages. Even if all 4 of them went Juggs, Red would be out, because
he would have no oil, Blue would be out because he would have no trees,
because everyone knows, blue has no trees on his island.
That would leave 3 vs 2 on
Juggs. We knew whoever was at purple (it turned out to be werm) would go
all land and sapper into Shaf and kill him. Shaf's hall was on the
sea, so he HAD to go juggs, yet he was sure to go down to purple's sapper
in. We knew Shaf was out no matter what.<P>

I was making plenty of jokes about Shaf's coming doom :)<P>

Well we got rolling. My strategy involved some dirty stuff. I went two
farms then built my mill. As soon as my mill was done, I built my
yard. I didn't have enough farms for a tanker so I made decision....<P>

In this game, Warp, Gotcha and I were all within listening distance. We
also had an audience across the hall watching Gotcha play. So I started
my acting.... In the big games, I like to do some voice acting during
the game.... So I yell:<P>

<b><i>
"I'm afraid, one of my peons must make the ultimate sacrifice for the good
of the others. Sometimes the innoncent must be sacraficed... The good
of the many out weigh the few or the one" <P>
</b></i>

I then 
<a href="PICS/s77g.jpg">
<b>murdered one of my peons.</b></a> Warp looked over at my monitor and said:
"Man Shlonglor is doing some weird stuff." Well, that left me with about 8
used and I trained a tanker and peon at the same time. I got the
tanker out. I ran as fast as I could ot the oil spot. It was free. YES!
I told Warp and Gotcha, I stole his oil. They were like: YEAH! :)
I was putting up the rig just as Shaf and everyone else on the team
was saying Shipyard. hahah. I had a rig going before anyone even had a yard up.
I made a 2nd tanker and went over to see Tarquinn's yard. It was still
building. I couldn't help but laugh. 
<a href="PICS/s77h.jpg"><b>Take a look</b></a> at
Tarquinn discovering that his oil was stolen :)
<P>

Well I thought we had them, but then Tarquin hopped a peon over and made
a barracks on my shore. I didn't have a barracks or anything because I did that
super water rush. I quickly got an unwalled in guard tower up outside my town.
I walked over to his barracks and started buliding walls around it. I was trying
to build a little wall around where the footmen was going to pop out. I
figured that if I could wall the footmen in it could save  me some time. It
was a brilliant strategic move. BUT, one of the peons got stuck where the 
footmen was supposed to pop out. Doh. It woulda worked good too. The
footmen would have had to break the wall down delaying him enough
for me to pop some Grunts. I had
2 peons repairing my barracks. He then built a guard tower outside his barracks.
I pumped one jug and began to hit his barracks. But in came Silverwolf and 
Flanker with juggs. They got my Jugg and started screwing me over. Warp
and Shaf were sending their juggs down to me. I was yelling at Warp to get 
the heck down here and bail me out :) Gotcha was up to Castle and was working on
sappering through to save me. During that time I was trying as hard as I could
to kill Tarquinn's peons. He would hop peon after peon over to my town. He
was building towers and beating me up bad. Then Gotcha finally sappered through.
He ran in with Knights and saved me. Phew.<P>

I was back in the stone age. Gotcha had Mages and I had 7 peons and Town
hall :)
Warp was trying to send down all the Juggs he could, Shaf too. They were getting
in big battles. Eventually they were able to kill Tarquinn's hall at least
once or twice. But, he started to pump gryphons. They were screwing Warp's
and Shaf's Juggs over.<P>

Well there I was. I had about 7 peons and Gotcha had just saved me. I started
pumping peons as fast as I could. I quickly got up to Keep, then Fortress.
During that time, Gotcha was protecting me with his Mages. Tarquinn sent in a
gryphon or two. Gotcha was yelling at me to start making axe throwers.
Gotcha and I killed or damaged some of the Gryphons.<P>

During this time, Shaf was invaded by Werm. Werm went all land and was
up to lust. Shaf said: "I'm dead guys." Werm had Dks, getting his tower.
He had some Juggs left over, but his town was gone. Shaf goes I have
5 Juggs where do I go? Me and Warp were all: "crap what has he been
doing?" We yelled: "Get the heck down to red you idiot!"
We needed Juggs down at red now. So Shaf rolls in with his juggs.
I believe they were able to kill Tarquinns hall for either the first or
2nd time.<P>

The enemy over came Warp and Shaf's Juggs eventually and took down my yard 
and all my sea stuff. Someone then took my oil spot. Looking
at the pictures later, I think it was flanker. He took Tarquinn's oil
spot who already had an oil spot in the middle of nowhere. They got got Shaf's
Juggs and he was shortly eliminated. They got Warp's sea stuff. They
didn't get Gotcha's because he had Mages. It was looking really bad.<P>

Warp invaded Silverwolf. All he had for defense was some walled
in peons on gold. Warp was really ripping up Silverwolf bad when
Tarquinn's Gryphons came in to save Silverwolf. Warp's invasion
was beaten off.<P>

We knew we had to take back Shaf's place from Werm. Gotcha was
already running Blizzard runs on the place with invisible transports.
He would land, Blizzard the place, then get back into his
invisible transport. Werm would try to rune the place where he thought
the transport was. Gotcha would land, pop out the mage, then move the
transport. Werm would rune the place where the transport USED to be,
then Gotcha would get back on the invisible transport at the spot
where the runes were not. haha. It was pretty funny. Warp had hasted,
lusted Dragons he would send in and attack the place, and then run.
Werm had lots of Dks, but Gotcha and Warp were wearing him down with
their 1 2 combo. One time Gotcha popped out the mage, blizzarded Werm's
peons at Shaf's old town, then got back in, went down to Silver's
place and Blizzard them too haha.<P>

But we weren't doing good. We knew we had to take werm's place.
I built a shipyard and had Gotcha protect it with Blizzard. I was
able to get about 2 Juggs and 2 destroyers out. But Flanker came over
and took my yard. Gotcha was able to Blizzard some of the ships. I
built another yard in the inlet between Yellow and White. I got
out some transports. I had a load of 5 or so Ogres with Bloodlust. 
I had Gotcha make my transport invisible. I
went up toward Werms place to invade. I was going to invade on the
very left side of Shaf's island and sneak in right by Warp's place. I
was about to land when I saw 2 of Werm's Ogres on the shore. Just
then..... Tarquinn drops. CRAP!<P>

We got into the chatroom. Man. Silverdork was talking some shit. One
of them said, we don't even need Tarquinn. Man bullshit. If Tarquinn
hadn't screwed me over, I woulda jugged their ass hard core. Man
I couldn't believe that crap. That pissed me off. I said, well i'd be
glad to play Shaf, Me, Warp, and Gotcha vs them 3 if they wanted to
afterwards. Werm then said, "Nice little invasion shlong." I guess
he saw my guys about to land and knew they were coming. Well crap.
I went into the other room and I started talking to Gotcha and Warp
about what the plan was. We were going to invade Werm. So after Tarquinn
made it back in the chatroom, I launched the saved game.<P>

Instead of invading Werm, I went down and Invaded Silverwolf. He didn't
have a thing. I killed his peons and went straight for the hall.
Silverwolf was just building a blacksmith. hahahha. I had lusted Ogres
in his town. hhaah. I got his keep and started working on his smith.
But in came 2 of Tarquinns Gryphons. I attacked the smith anyway. I
got another trans full of 2 or 3 berzerkers and some Ogres. During that
time I only had 3 Ogres left and Tarquinn was nailing them with
Gryphons. I got the Ogres and Axers over to Silver's island. I lusted
up the Axers. Werm had 2 Dragons there attacking me too.
I got 2 or 3 Gryphons and then Werm ran with the last one. I had 
the island. I took out everthing on Silver's island but the shipyard.
<P>

Gotcha and Warp were saying that we had to invade Werm at Shaf's place
NOW. They had both been attacking it. Gotcha would blizzard the peons.
Warp kept sending in Dragons, hasted with Bloodlust. But that wasn't
doing it. So I loaded up 2 transports with Ogres and Axe throwers. Gotcha
made them both invisible. I landed on the shore out of range. But
Werm runed the place where I was going to attack. 2 of the Ogres
ran in and died in the runes against my commands. Stupid Ogres :)
I decided I should retreat. I put the 6 guys in one transport, and 4
in the other. I moved them back and approached the island from
another side. I landed, lusted what I could and charged. In retrospect,
I should have ditched those stupid archers. All my guys died, but I
took some Ogres and peons and stuff with them.<P>

Sometime around this, Warp was saying a transport was coming to invade
him. He had taken his hasted Dragons over to Werm's 2nd island (Shaf's
ex place) and he noticed Werm's transport coming to invade him. He sent
the Dragons back to get the transport. Warp said we have to get
that thing before it lands, otherwise he is screwed. We were
both chanting "GO GO GO GO GO" as the Dragons were attacking
the transport. They sunk it just before it got to the shore. Warp
and I were yelling "YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"<P>

I was watching Tarquinn's place. He loaded up 2-3 transports full of
guys. He had a bunch of Knights and about 5 Mages. I tried to get
Warp to intercept them but he wasn't able to. They landed on
Shaf's island. It was clear the whole team was making their defense
at that mine.<P>

I had killed all the stuff at Silverwolf's town but his yard. I got
what was left of my invasion part, which was a few axers and some Ogres
and invaded Tarquinn. I was beating away on Tarquinn's town when
he sent in a load of Knights. I fought with the Knights and thanks
to bloodlust, I won with 2 Ogres and an axer. I finished off
all of his good buildings. I was beating on his hall, when somehow, I
think using a peon, he killed my axer. I had 2 Ogres left on Tarquinn's
island. I finished off the Castle. That left 4 farms, a yard and
foundry. I left them alone.<P>

I flew over Silverwolf's and there he was mining. I was totally
surprised. We spent all that time fighting to get Shaf's mine back from
werm and we totally forgot all about the mine at Silverwolfs. I ran
in with 6 Bloodlusted Ogres and took the place. The Ogres then guarded
the mine. I was pretty much out of money. I told Gotcha and Warp that
I was going to invade Werm on a suicide mission to get those Mages. I
invaded and got 2 Mages and damaged the other 2 or 3. Warp then came
in with the hasted, Lusted Dragons and finished them off. We discovered
that Silverwolf had set up a town at Shaf's with Werm. We also
discovered werm had sappered through to Orange, Shaf's place. That is
how he was so easily defending it with his Ogres. He sappered in a weird
spot that was hard to notice.<P>

I told Gotcha he should quickly come get Silverwolf's mine. There was
20k left in it. Gotcha landed and began setting up. Silverwolf landed
too and was also trying to take the mine. I had ferried over 2 transport
loads of peons from my town to Silverwolf's. I used all of them to
attack
Silverwolf's hall he was putting up. Warp helped me with his Dragons
It was an awesome sight. You can
see it in <a href="PICS/s77b.jpg">
<b>this picture.</b></a> Gotcha set up his hall and built some
Guard Towers. All of the enemies navy surrounded the place and flanker
sent in some footmen, and tried to lure us to the shore to get us
with his juggs. HEY. We invented that man! haha. Like we would fall
for that. I had my peons run toward the shore and run back to our
towers. I tried to do the trick the opposite way. Eventually, the towers
took the footmen.<P>

We were then invaded by at least 1 Werm Ogre, and some other unknown
forces. I was back to my play acting. I yell into the other room:
<P>

<i><b>
Enemy invasion. Peon Army responding to the situation. Peon army
engaging the enemy. (After the enemy was killed) Peon army has
routed the enemy. Returning to defense positions....</b></i><P>

I had the audience over at Gotcha's room rolling. It was funny :)<P>

After the enemy invasion, I planned on 
<a href="PICS/s77k.jpg">
<b>walling in that guard tower</b></a>
of Gotcha's. But I ran out of money doh!<P>

Gotcha got a transport with at least 2 Mages over to the island to
further it's defense. He then planned on Blizzarding the huge armada
laying seige to the island. He didn't have a flyer so he had
me take
<a href="PICS/s77l.jpg">
<b>this picture of the armada's demise.</b></a>

I then took my peons
and surounded the mages to defend them as seen in
<a href="PICS/s77i.jpg">
<b>here.</b></a><P>

Just then I spied an 
<a href="PICS/s77m.jpg">
<b>enemy white peasant</b></a><P>

<i><b>The Peon army has spotted an enemy invasion of our island.
(Gotcha & Warp: What is it?) A lone peon. I think the Peon army
can handle it! (Peon army kills the enemy peasant) I fought off
the invasion. It was viscious, but the peon army was able to win.
(Everyone in the other room was rolling :)</b></i><P>

It wasn't too long when an invasion of 6 Axers from Silverwolf came in.
Their target was Gotcha's Mages. I attacked the Archers with all my
peons. Gotchas Paladins with healing also engaged. While Silverwolf
was trying for the Mage that was there, Gotcha was healing it.
Silverwolf's Axers were killed without doing any damage whatsoever.
Hahaha. Silverwolf then turned on the messages and said something about
his displeasure about not getting it. hahaha. A little while later
1 grunt came in and tried for mage again. He got it down to about
10-20 hit points but we killed the grunt with the peons. haha. 
Foiled again! Silverwolf said something about that mage was his. haha.
DENIED.<P>

As soon as we had healing a short time earlier, Gotcha healed all
4 of Warp's Dragons. He healed everything else we had.<P>

Then Gotcha took Werm's 2nd island, (Shaf's old island)
Silverwolf was defending it, and Gotcha and Warp said it was pretty much
axers only defending it. There was about 1100-1200 left in the mine.
I think it was 1200.<P>

Shaf's, Werm's, and Silverwolf's island were now
under our control. I took a flight over flankerX's island. All he
had was 3 guard towers. CRAP. We could have taken that easily.
<P>

I noticed Flanker was pumping footmen still. 
I also noticed that he was making Destroyers.
So I sent Warp's Dragons
over to get his barracks. Warp started attacking it, I'm not sure
if he got it or not, but Flanker built some archers. He also had
a destroyer on the shore that I think was hitting the dragons. So
I told Warp to retreat. An archer was standing by the river between
Silverwolf's (well OUR island) and Flankers. So I had 
<a href="PICS/s77n.jpg">
<b>Gotcha Polymorph it</b></a> Maybe I should say Pigacized it.<P>

It was around then that they started talking about how pointless this
was. It was a stalemate. BULLSHIT. I said to them, No way, we can
win this. They laughed at us. Silverwolf starts saying no way. He
said to take a flight over the middle. I had theorised that
they probably had 4-5 Destroyers. Those would easily be killed
by some Hasted, Lusted, Dragons combined with healing. I took
a flight over the middle and I was able to spot about 6 or so
destroyers. But they charged my flyer. Those Jerks! They set a
trap for my flyer. I thought they would pull some crap like that. 
I quickly got my flyer back home.<P>

They had a ton of destroyers in the middle. Those jerks had
made a bunch of destroyers and put them all in the middle surrounded
by transports, tankers and flyers, to cause a stalemate. That
seems like a pretty jerky thing to me. Warp said he would
have done the same if he were them. Not me man. That's pretty
gay. Gotcha said: "Yeah that's pretty gay." hahaha.<P>

Pretty soon after, we eliminated Silverwolf. I heard Gotcha yell
from the other room: "hahahhaha ELIMINATION!" hahaha.<P>

Sometime around then, I heard Warp go, shoot my Dk is gone. I look
over at his screen and where the dk was supposed to be, there was
nothing. I go where did it go? He said: "I'm not sure." Hahaha.
Later I learned from Werm that he had used a sapper and an Ogre
to kill it and at least 1 Ogre. So that meant no more haste
for the Dragons. DOH! During that time I had taken the 2 Ogres
left on Tarquinn's island and landed them on Gotcha's. My transport
was sunk. I had no more transports and no money. I had 2 Ogres
with about 2-10 hit points on Gotcha's island. I had 1 flyer, and
a bunch of peons on Silverwolf's old place.<P>

Gotcha then started yelling Sappers Sappers. Move your Ogres at my
place. I headed right with the Ogres but then saw the sappers run
above me toward the left. I doubled back toward the sappers. I
got a few hits in. but first sapper hit the foundry. The next one
hit the foundry again and killed one of my ogres. Crap. Gotcha
couldn't make anymore transports. DOH!<P>

Warp then set his dragons on attacking Werm's place. He had 3 Dragons
on the place. 1 had died before it could be moved earlier. Warp
then walked into Gotcha's room. I yelled at him to watch his dragons.
He said, what for, they can't get them with anything. I said, ok. I
knew that was probably our only hope.<P>

We then theorized what we should do. I said that we should take flankers
place. We should also get rid of Werm. We then figured that we
could use bloodlusted hit and run combined with healing to
get those destroyers. We went back to my room, Warp and I.<P>

Gotcha and Warp took Flankers main island except for his shipyard. They
also got rid of Werm as I hear Gotcha yell from the other room:
"Eliminationnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn" hahaha.<P>

Tarquinn starts talking about how stupid this is. I said we could win
but they didn't believe us. He said, well I'm going to quit. Flanker
can stay for the stalemate. YEAH WHATEVER BUDDY! I don't think
I said that however :) He left.<P>

I flew over the middle and saw
<a href="PICS/s77o.jpg">
<b>this.</b></a> You think that's bad? That's not even all of his
ships. You'll see a better picture of them later. HOLY CRAP!<P>

Ok here was the situation. We had 1200 gold in the mine at Shaf's old
place. We had 1 Ogre with 2 or so hit points of mine. Warp had
1 or 2 on his island. Gotcha had 2 Oil tankers, and a transport. We
were all out of money. We had no shipyards, Gotcha had one shipyard.
I said to Warp and Gotcha:<P>

"How many Destroyers do you think he has? Oh
you know what? Hahahaha... Let me ask him.. Flanker: How many destroyers
do you have?" Flanker: "16" I figured I was on a roll.. Shlonglor:"how
many flyers?" Flanker: "3"<P>

What would you do vs 16 Destroyers with
only 2 tankers, a transport, 2 Mages with all the spells, a paladan
with healing, one Ogre with lust? 
I put that question even to
Vermeer and Shaf afterwards and they had NO IDEA :) That's why
only the Andrews boys™ could win this game! :)<P>

Flanker then said something about leaving. He said I gotta go
somewhere but i'll leave my computer on. I walked into
Gotcha's room as did Warp.
I said, I've got it, (I'm pretty sure it was my idea) how about
flame shielded, invisible tankers? hahah. Yeah! I said wouldn't
that be the ultimate to sink all those ships with one invisible,
flameshielded tanker while he was away. Wouldn't that be the ultimate
to sink all his ships while he was gone. He would come back to
find all his ships sunk. It was low down, but
come on. It was no more low down then trying to cause a stalemate
by making a bunch of destroyers then camping out in the middle.
That would just be the ULTIMATE to kill all those ships, win that
game and go back victorious.<P>

Gotcha then researched
flame shield. He made a tanker invisible and then flame shielded it.
<a href="PICS/s77e.jpg">
<b>He then set it after the ships.</b></a> 
They started taking big time damage.
Oh man that was funny. Flanker
goes: "YOU ASSHOLES!" hahhahahahhaha. MUHHHAHAHAHAHAHHA. 
That jerk had tried to trick us. He didn't really leave his computer.
I said: "What happened to you leaving your computer?" He said: "I did
leave but I came back." Yeah WHATEVER. He was trying to pull
a fast one on us.

We sent out the invisible tanker, with flameshield again 
figuring we could use this one tanker to get
his whole fleet. But he used attack ground and killed it. DOH. I
guess that wasn't going to easily win us the game.<P>

We sat there thinking of our next move. We were having another
conference in Gotcha's room along with our studio audience :)
It then came to me. Ogre Eye of Killrogg! I could place it over
the ships and they would shoot at each other. They would be in
a limitless supply so we could use that to win. YEAH everyone yelled.
I ran in the room and launched an eye. I flew over to
the ships and they all started shooting at each other.
<a href="PICS/s77p.jpg">

<b>as you can see in this picture.</b></a> I sunk 2 and damaged some
more. I made another eye and got 1 or 2 destroyers more. hahahha.
I said to flanker, "only 13 more destroyers now :)" I sent another
eye over and NOTHING HAPPENED! The Ships didn't fire. Flanker goes:
"no more of that. I allied you" THAT ASSHOLE. That is freakin LOW.
Allying me so his guys wouldn't shoot at my eyes. It was a brilliant 
strategic move on his part. I would have never thought of that. I talked
to some other people and they said they just would have just seperated
their ships. Flanker had allied Warp also so he wouldn't fire at his
eyes either. CRAP. That was going to win us the game.<P>

Gotcha had gotten the rest of the money from Shaf's mine. Before he got
it we had figured we would make a Sub and make it invisible, and
flame shield it. If he didn't have a flyer, which we were pretty sure
he didn't, that would be awesome. I had told Gotcha and Warp to
attack Flanker's flyers. We killed 2 of them. I figured that he
didn't have anymore. I had asked him and he said he had 3, but 
I didn't see any, anywhere. So I figured he was lying. Lying like
he did about leaving his computer :)<P>

Gotcha got all the money back from
the mine and found that he was like 70 or so gold short.
CRAPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <P>

What really pissed me off is I had a peon sitting there by Gotcha's
hall with a bag of gold in his hand. After playing diablo, you
know it would be cool to just drop that bag and have gotcha's peon pick
it up. I mean come on we are allies. All he needed was 100 gold.<P>

So Gotcha started making a destroyer. He was planning on making that
invisible and flame shield it.
I then said, "hey wait wait cancel, when the destroyer gets up
next to the ships it will fire at the ships and it will become
uninvisble or visible rather." Gotcha said: "Yeah you're right." He
canceled. He built a transport instead.<P>

Gotcha then said, hey if he is allied with you and Warp, I think
it's time to send the dragons in. With him allied, they won't be able
to fire. I Lusted the Dragons up with the Ogre and they attacked. Warp
got one of the ships and ran back. We then immediately sent over
the eyes so if he unallied, the ships would fire at each other. No luck.
He was still allied. Gotcha then sent over the transport he made, with
it invisible and flame shielded. 
He sunk one or damaged them real bad.
He kept it moving in eradict paterns to keep the ships from firing at it. 
After the flame shield wore off he ran home.<P>

Flanker tried to chase the transport a few times but he would return
to the middle once he got near the shore. One real close call he
had followed the transport with a few destroyers, and just as
the transport became visible, the destroyers were hot on it's tail.
He ran with it to the shore, and just before the destroyers were going
to kill it, the mage made it invisible. YEAH HAHAHHAHAHAH. Gotcha
then blizzarded those Destroyers. Yeah baby! We sent some more eyes
over. We figured it was time for another dragon raid. Warp sent over
the Dragons again with lust, but this time the dragons accidently
fired on a tanker of flankers. One Dragon was killed before it could
return. CRAP! We had 2 Dragons left.<P>

Gotcha sent the invisible transport
with flame shield out again. Flanker was ready and fired with attack
ground. Luckily he missed. Gotcha damaged some more ships BIG TIME.
I had a flyer watching. I saw his peasant on the shore repairing
but the funny thing was his transport was still invisible. I didn't
get a screenshot. But have you ever seen a peasant repair an invisible
transport before? I haven't, it was pretty funny.<P>

Gotcha was making his flyers invisible and we would plant them over
flankers ships. He never even knew hahahha. We took a look and
almost every ship he had was in the red. 
<a href="PICS/s77q.jpg">
<b>This is all that was left.</b></a>

He had 7 Destroyers and 2 battleships, all dead.
When i had killed number 12, I said to flanker: "1 down, 12
to go" Then we killed a few more. I asked flanker how many he had left
now. He said "13" hahahhaa. I said to Warp and Gotcha. Hmmm He only
had 12 a while ago, and now it's up to 13? hahahha. He was obviously
talking outta his arse :)<P>

It was then flanker yells: <font color=red size=+3>Remeber the Alamo!</font>
He charged with all his ships to Gotcha's shore. Gotcha blizzard the
the whole bloody lot. Just a few of them can be seen
<a href="PICS/s77a.jpg">
<b>here.</b></a> I sure as hell didn't want to use the only flyer
i had left to Blizzard & Destroyers :)<P>

Flanker had a few ships left but he knew we could kill them. The truth
is, we might not have been able to. He might have got lucky and killed
the transport or Dragons. I woulda played it out. But instead he
charged. He then surrendered!<P>

Gotcha then took a

at the end.<P>

YEAH! OH man. I went to kchat as fast as I could, grabbing a stat
screen shoot of course. I yell out in kchat. WE WON. FUCK YOU!!!!
Their side went: NO WAY! I heard they had been talking about the
stalemate they had made with us the whole time. SUCK ON THAT FOOLS!!
hahahha. That was just the ultimate acheivement of my war2 career
to walk into kchat and scream out our victorious cry and stick it to
them. Those jerks had been talking it up in the chatroom during that
drop, they had been talking it up saying stalemate, they had been
in kchat during the game talking it up, and what happened. ANDREWS
BOYS SKOOLED YOUR ASS!!!!!! Oh man. Warp, Gotcha, I and everyone in
our room watching was so excited. Never had I had such a victory
feeling such as that. I wanted to tell Shaf but he was in a game.
Tarquinn was no where to be found. When Shaf got back, I told him. 
He said NO WAY! of course :) I then questioned him. I asked him
what he would have done against 16 destroyers with 2 tankers, a
transport and the other stuff we had. He had no clue :) Almost
as cool as sticking it to Werm and Silverwolf in kchat, and sticking it
to Tarquinn when he came on later. Hahahha. He didn't believe we won
either.
That is until we told him we used flame shielded invisible transports.
I think he liked that. The game was over. We had overcome a 3on4. We
had beaten all possible odds against us. Andrews boys had once
took an impossible situation and turned it into a win.<P>

The game lasted almost 4 hours!!!!! Shaf had played 2 games while
we were still in that one :)<P>

And now to the game discussion which is almost as big as the story.
:)<P>

This was the kind of a game you could retire on. I know I've said
it before, but I have a hard time believing any game could be
as big and more satisfying than this one.<P>

What was so neat about this game is almost every strat was used in
this game. We had Invisible Transports, Hasted/Lusted Dragons, Dragons,
Gryphons, Invisible, Lusted Dragons, Invisible flame shielded tankers,
transports, Juggs, Destroyers, Runes, Polymoph, Slow, Hasted Dks,
peon battles, archer battles, Sappers, repairing transports...
Just about everthing was used in the game but Raise the Dead, Unholy
Armor and Whirlwinds. And another amazing thing is just about
all of those contributed to the win. Had we not had Warp's Dragons
we would have lust, or Gotcha's Mages, or My Lusted Ogres, or
invisible transports. Everything came together. Everyone on
the team, even Shaf did their part to win us the game.<P> 

I talked to Werm and their plan was for Flanker and Silverwolf to Go
all Juggs. I believe that might have been Tarquinns plan too. Werm
was to go straight up to lust and go all land taking out whoever was
at Orange (Who turned out to be Shaf) Flanker went all sea. Normally
people at Blue run out of lumber after a few Juggs, but he set up
a lumber mill on Tarquinn and Shaf's 2nd island. He also set up
a Shipyard and Rig at Tarquinn's place (Red) He did nothing but
pump Juggs and Destroyers. He did pump a few footmen but
they didn't do too much. We were kicking ourselves over not invading
him. We could have easily put an end to his ship days. He only
had about 3 Guard towers protecting his down. A Dk and some lusted
Ogres could have taken him out quite easily. What was even worse
was he was pumping Juggs and Destroyers even up to the end of
the game. Had we invaded earlier, we would have had less ships to deal
with.<P>

Silverwolf was also going all sea. But we cut him short of making
too many Juggs luckily. He did do some major damage early on. But
Silver never properly defended his town. Warp who invaded him
first said all he had was his peons walled in. That's it. You can't
expect to last too long with those kind of defenses.<P>

Werm commented on how Tarquinn let them down. He had 5 Mages and a
bunch of knights and rather then attack us, he landed on Shaf's island
and got his Mages killed. Had he attacked any one of us, I'm sure
that would have won them the game. He could have put his Mages
on the shore and Blizzarded any of our towns. I think Gotcha's
would have been the hardest to take, but at least it would have
done some damage against us. I think I have to agree with Werm. Not
using those Mages to attack us was a big mistake.<P>

But I'm going to place a lot of the blame on Silverwolf (The War 2
Whore) Had he not given us his mine, and I mean GIVEN, there is
no way we could have won. Thanks DUDE! :)<P>

But everyone in the team should be commended, they all played
great. Just some better then others. I don't think anyone in
that game was dissatisfied with it, even the losers. We all
had fun.<P>

Well this is the story of the longest game that I have ever played.
The teams were Me(Wermacht) Silverwolf, Tarquinn, and FlankerX, against
the andrew boys and shaf.  Well This is what happened.  Me and my
teamates formulated a plan.  They would head to tarquin immediately since
he got bottom left and wait for a fleet that would surely come and kill him.
While I was supposed to make land troops and take out whoever top right
was(shaf it was btw).  Anyway as we go along a wrinkle in our plan happened.
Shlong went two farms then mill and stole tarquinns oil the little prick:).
Anyways we were starting to think what we could do. Tarquinn going all sea
was going to be a disaster because of the distances involved with getting
oil for him and himself going to get killed in the sea.  So we decided to
have him upgrade and go for dragons.  What surprised me was, and really
surprised shlong is when tarquinn jumped from his spot and started to tower
shlong who was just above bot left.:)...  Needless to say shlong was in trouble because he went all sea.  So now it was a 2 on 2 on the
sea with me and tarquinn going land and shlong beingv forced to go land as
well as for gotcha.  Well I got too Stronghold really quick threw two
bells up as well as a temple and starting making dks and sappers.  Well
incase you didn't know it takes two sappers to blow from mid top right to
top right.  As I said earlier shaf was top right so he was forced to go
ships.  When I came in on him i had 3 sappers going and around 9 lvl 4
ogres and a dk in the oven.  Well I go in use one sapper to get thru.
So then I move my troops thru the crack and then move my second sapper.
Boom, doh i clicked on a damn rock so i only had one sapper left.
My guys were within Shafs cannon range so i back off and my third sapper
goes in and gets his farm.   But DOH i fucked that up too.  A damn peasant
came in and put a farm.  Doh.  So i wait around a minute or two and my dk
finishes.  In the meantime my ogres are dissassembling shafs town from out
of the range of shafs cannon.  My dk gets done and a i fry his tower.
End of shaf after that.  He had some ships i guess but silverwolf sent in
2 or 3 juggs to kill them.  So now i have control of that mine and my own.
My mine runs out i build a hall up at shafs old one. This is the first
stage of the game. From this point Silverwolf and FlankerX took
everyone of the andrew boys off the sea and now we have the money advantage.
<P>
Now the second part begins.  We were going good I was worried about gotcha
because i knew he went land.  I didn't have much wood but i wanted to mine
the mine out asap to deny shlonglor or gotcha from overpowering me from
getting it.  Then As i expecting it starting to have unseasonable weather.
What i didnt suspect was b4 that Warp comes in with some hasted lusted dks.
DOH.  And while my guys were milling around in confusion gotcha would
come in and blizzard my guys.  I still had plenty of cash but was lacking
on wood.  So i start pumping dks out in hope of coiling his guys.
As I look back on that I probably should have just saved my money, but
afterthought as they say is a 20 20.  Well as this is happening
silverwolf is invaded by shlongs or Gotchas knights.  Not sure which.
I was like DOH.  Silverwolf was bailed out by tarquinns birds.
But eventually shlong came in with some axmen and finished them off.
Now this is the key to the game.  If silverwolf would have mined the
mine out we were in great shape.  But he left 20 GRAND in the mine.
This would be important later in the game.  As i was successfully fending
my mine off from dragons orges and mages.  After shlong finished with
killing silver off mostly he comes for me.  He lands around 12 ogres on my
island, i get 2 from runing.  Then WARP comes in with his damn dragons
again and scatters my guys.  When it doesnt look good tarquinn comes and
bails me out.  He brouhgt 8 knights and 4 mages.  a couple of mages died
but what was important was i was able to fend shlong off again after
lusting Tarquinns knights.  This is where things fell apart.  I wanted
tarquinn to hit either Gotcha or warp and hit their mages.  Instead he
elected to stay.  As things were, I could fend off shlongs attacks
directly but those damn dragons restricted me.  With what little wood i
had i decided to take matter into my own hands.  I wanted warps DKS dead.
But since no one could do it i decided to go kill them myself.  My first
attemp with my peons failed.  He saw it coming. So the next time I loaded
my last ogre and peon in it. Landed and killed one dk.  One was remaining.
So i have 1000 gold left.  I knew that we were not going to win but had
a chance at a draw.  So I told FlankerX to make more destroyers for
dragon attacks would have to come.  And myself with the last of my money,
i built a sapper.  With this sapper, i snuck it onto warp's island and
killed the last of warps dks.  Warp still had 3 dragons but he could only
lust them and not use haste which is deadly.  After this i did some
scouting.  We relized that the key to the game was for us to go for a
draw.  We weren't going to win because of Gotcha and his mages.  But
we did know we could gamble for a draw.  Flanker made 12 destroyers that
game and kept them center.  He also had a couple of sappers at home.
We knew that gotcha was getting the bulk of the money and were not quite
sure how much shlong had.  SO that is when we decided to get gotchas
Foundry.  First sapper made it with flying colors.  Gotchaslowed the last sapper, but it got to the foundry.
Realizing now that gotcha yard was weak Flanker sent in a battleship.
I will let shlong tell you the rest of the story because i was finally
eleminated after all this:)....oh and it was 3 hours later too
<P>

<hr size=2 width=90%>

	This would have to be the coolest game of all time in my opinion. Well It started 
out with me on the bottom right which is  really cramped for wood as you all know, 
Silverwolf was above me, Tarquinn was next to me in the worst spot on the map, and Wermacht 
was right above Silverwolf. Ok we planed out that me and Silverwolf would go sea, but I 
didn't really think too much about this because I always go "ALL" sea, but I would later 
find out that there was a hich, but anyways, We start out and going pretty smoothly
untill I hear Tarquinn go Doh my oil got stolen, (It was Shlongs cheap ass who did this) 
but Tarq wasnt outta of it he hopped Shlong and bulit a barracks and towered him. Ok I'm 
running smoothly now I had 2 yards and my foundry up I was pumping juggs out my wazoo, 
I saw Shlong had try to rebuild his yard so I sent over a few juggs and wiped it off
the face of the Earth.  Then a few enemy Juggs come over and me and Silver just kill them.
Now I was getting Short on wood so that stopped me for a few mins, I asked around to
find out where I could "mooch" so wood from, Werm said I could get some off his expansion 
Isle. So I set up shop there, I also had a few peons at Tarquinns base too. So I'm back in 
the game, Then I see 4 or 5 hasted bloodlusted dragons fly over my wood peons on Werms
base. He tells me to start pumping Destroyers to help fend off the dragons since we 
controled the sea. So I pumped 15 or so destroyers when I realize this is pointless
so I start to make some me, I upgraded to keep and got some flyers and 3 sappers. I had 
2 transports full of level 2 grunts so I send them up to Werms expansion to help, I 
landed just in time, Shlong(I think) had just landed a transport of level 7 orges and he 
bloodlusted them, with the help a Werms troops we wiped them out. Now I hear Silverwolf 
is in trouble so I  send a tansport over there but a mage blizzard it before I could unload.
Meanwhile I hunted down about 6 transports with my 16 destroyers, I would lock em all onto
a single transport and chase em down :) .  Silver was dead and I hear them go ELIMONATION!
So I see them scouting me out so I load my 3 sappers onto a trans and say "What should 
I hit I got 3 sappers?" Wermy tells me to hit Gotchas foundry, I get there and unload 2 of
em but the thrid was still in the boat when it got sunk, But my first one hit without a 
problem but the second one got slowed and was almost killed by a orge, but it got there just 
in time, destroying the foundry and killing the orge. Ok I dont remember what else 
happend till the every end when I was the last person left. I remember setting up a 
formation with 2 juggs in the middle and they were surrounded by destroyers, because
destroyes cant attack ground so if they got them I would be screwed. Well I was in
a decitfull mode so I say "I'll be back later, I'm just gonna leave the computer on."
But I decided to stay, I see an Invisable transport with flame shield come, I locked onto 
it with my juggs and destroyed it. They were like "So your gone huh?" I was rolling
then they send over Kilrogs eye and my destroyers just start fireing at each other
I lost about 3 destroyers on that. But then I go "Ah ha" I allied them :). The next time 
they sent em in the eye was just floating above them. They decided to send in the 4 dragons 
Warp had left over. I got 2 of em and that was the last I saw of them. Well then I was
getting really board, and I was thinking of Famous last words thats when I shouted 
"REMEMBER THE ALAMO" I charged in with all of my ships and killed their last transport 
I lost about 6 ships because of blizzard. I had about 5 destroyers left near the top
of the map when I decided to give up. Afterwords in Chat it dawned on me I 
should have just moved up to the top and the transports could have never got me. I was
pissed. But then we all decided that, That was probally the coolest game in War2 history.
Happy now Shlong its done now  :)
