It was my last night on Kali for the school year on my ethernet. I had thought I wouldn't
get onto kali again until late September. So Vermeer and I decided to try a 2 vs 6 on
crowded.pud. I usually play this level against newbies or just the uniformed. But Vermeer
had to go onto Starlink Kchat where all the big boys were and said, anyone that wants
to go 2 vs 6 against me and Shlonglor, join my (Vermeer's) game. I'm thinking DOH. It was
bad enough to go 2 vs 6 against crappy players but the good ones? Well the crew wanted
a piece of me and Vermeer. Dirga and Clear joined, pretty good players. 4 other moderately
good to bad players joined. We told them the teams, Me and Vermeer vs ALL. After they
stopped laughing, we began.<p>

Everyone was surprized to see what crowded looks like. If you haven't seen it, take a look
at it and this story and game will make sense. Well I first build my barracks and smith, and 2nd
farm. I had the repair action out to get those buildings up fast. I pumped out 3 Grunts, up to
level 3 by then and hacked through the walls seperating me and Jung. I charged in
and wasted him. He did't understand what to do so he went DOWN. That left 5. Just then,
Dand came up on the drop screen. After a while, we dropped him. That left 4.<p>

Just about then, I hear Vermeer saying he is dead. I'm not sure what happened to him but
he was out. Crap! That left me vs 4!!!! I was about ready to throw in the towel. By then I
had gotten up my second hall up closer to the mine because as you know, (should know),
the first hall is about a 1000 miles away from the mine. I built a lumber mill and started making
catapults. Vermeer was asking what was going on. I said well I maybe going down, but I'm going
to trash something before I die. I was feeling pretty screwed. I started pumping out the cats.
I sent them over and started hitting Dirga and Clear's town. I got some of Dirga's farms and
hit a lot of Clear's stuff.<p>

The game progressed and I got up to Stronghold and Fortress. Hades began to send Dragons over.
This really screwed me over. I built the Dks and Axers to fight them. I got up to fortress and
got the bloodlust. I grouped some Ogres together. I then sappered into Dirga and Hades Square.
I sent in the bloodlusted Ogres. Hades, Aftershock and Dirga were all attacking me. I was also
still getting hit by Dragons. Have you ever fought 3 players at once? It was wierd because
all the guys I was attacking were under good control because all three players were
devoting their time to me. I on the other hand had a big mess of Ogres all spread out and
it was impossible to control them all. I fought Dirga's sappers and other land troops. Bloodlust
gave me a huge advantage. Dirga didn't put up much of a fight. I learned why later after
the game why. I'll tell you why later.
<p>

While I was attacking, Clear kept blizzarding my town from his square of the map.
That got me really hating those pesky Humans. Hades kept sending in the Dragons. Then I
decided, screw Hades, I'm going to go get rid of those Dragons. I sent in the Bloodlusted Ogres
and started killing his peons and hall. With bloodlust, I quickly laid waste to his peons and
hall. While this was going on, he had 3 Dragons on my town. As soon as I destroyed Hades
hall he quit! He QUIT! He had 3 dragons and lots of other stuff. That made me think Hades
is a real wuss. It also lent credience to my theory that the Hall is like the Army Generals
in the old times. If the General got killed or ran, everyone else ran too no matter how much 
they had. So my theory is you don't have to kill the enemy, just destroy their hall and they
will quit on their own :) That is sorta like the my shipyard is gone so I'm quiting thing.<p>

Well I kept sending in more Ogres and some Death Knights. About that time, Aftershock was
like "What? He's winning? How can one person beat 4?" haha. Aftershock wasn't much of
a challenge to fight there. He had a bunch of level 1 Grunts. haha. I started beating on
him too. Then I got some sappers and sappered my way top right to Clear. I ran in
and killed his Mages. Then it was over! Vermeer couldn't belive I pulled it out. Neither could
I.<p>

That game was just so awesome. 1 on 4! Well to give the other players some credit, crowded
is a screwed up trick pud. If you don't know what's going on you die. But really, to win, all you
gotta figure out is you need a 2nd hall closer to the mine and it seems like any idiot would 
think of that when they see the map. But surprisingly, many people, even good players, try to
mine it long distance even though the mine is about 1/2 the map away from the hall. So
I get a second closer hall and that allows me to take on 3 or more players.
<p>

After the game, Clear, Dirga and Aftershock were really nice. Dirga explained why he didn't
do much. I guess Hades built a Temple of the Damned in front of Dirga's peons and blocked
all Dirga's peons in. haha his own teammate took him out of game. So Hades quits when his
hall dies AND blocks in his own teammate. LOOOOOSSSSSSEEEEEERRRR :)<p>

Although this isn't the most exciting story, what makes it so neat is it was 2 on 5, that came
down to 1 on 4 and I still won. Another cool thing was it was my last game for the
school year and for what I thought for the summer and it was so cool.
