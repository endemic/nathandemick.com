<STRONG>Marshall and Azure vs Krieg and WarpMaster 5 Mar 96</STRONG></H3>
</font>
<BR>
Well, Krieg and Warp decided they wanted to challenge us to
                an IWL match.  Naturally, Azure and I picked plains of snow.
                Hey, we like the map :).  Anyway, I'm Orange, Azure is Yellow,
                Warp is Purple(I think, I might have the colors switched),
                and Krieg was Green.  I was a little worried, since both of
                them wouldn't have much trouble ganging up on me, while
                Azure would have to navigate his troops around the center
                mines.  Well, I quickly starting building up troops and
                upgrading them, and had about 5 footmen when I was attacked by
                Purple.  The numbers were about equal, but his were in
                a ragged line so mine could gang up.  Seeing victory at
                that battle, I told Azure to go hit purple while I kept his
                troops busy. <BR><BR> Just then I kill off the purple troops
                and a bunch of green footmen run in.  Well, I still had
                most of my troops left, and was producing more, so I killed
                these too.  Then Azure reports that he is slaying most of
                purple's peons, but I hear him say "Green".  So I run
                up to purple (since I figure we might as well hit both
                of them) and run in to meet Azure.  "WOW, I thought,
                he not only killed Green's peons but he also is killing 
                purple's.  Well, we finish off purple's peons but soon lose
                our footmen there to the remaining troops. <BR><BR> While
                this is going on, however, I'm upgrading to a keep and 
                starting a 2nd town hall at Black, while Azure expands north
                to White.  I send out some footmen to watch the other
                gold mines at Blue and Red to make sure they don't expand.
                I build some knights and 3 more barracks, bringing me to 4
                total.  I go over to hit green, figuring I might as well
                finish him off and discover that he hasn't really been hit
                much at all (Azure explains to me later that I misunderstood, he
                never hit green).  Boy was I surprised to see all those  troops.<BR><BR>
                Well, I did outnumber him, so I kept him busy for a while while 
                keeping 4 barracks running at full.  Soon, I prepare to attack
                purple, who does have a lot of towers, but hasn't expanded.
                Before I go, I notice tha green has tried to expand to Blue, so
                I send down a couple of knights and stop that.  I
                lose a lot of knights attacking purple's towers, even
                though Azure is telling me to just pull back and
                wait for his demo teams.  I probably should have, but
                I was getting cocky, since I didn't see any expansion on their
                part. <BR><BR> Well, I did lose a lot of knights, but I also killed
                all of his peons off afterwards, so it was costly, but we had
                some money to burn.  I sent another group of knights to watch
                green and notice this entire peon baggage train booking for the
                center.  I assign 1 knight to each peon as quickly as
                possible and watch them kill all of the peasants.  At this
                point Krieg says "I think it's over, they have about a million
                knights".  The battle continues for a while, as Azure and I race
                to destroy the last remaining farms.   My demo team beats his
                to one last farm and after taking out a last few grunts the
                game ends.  <BR><BR><BR><font color=red><b>Marshall</font></b>

<font color=00cc66><STRONG>Marshall and Azure vs. Chrism and Shlonglor (2 March 1996)</STRONG></font>
<BR><BR>
Shlonglor and Chrism challenged us to an iwl match.
                We said "EIT!" (well, not exactly).
                <BR><BR>
                We picked (guess what?) plains of snow, high resources, town hall first.
                Anyway, I build about 9 level 4 footmen and notice that I'm not being
                attacked.  Neither is Azure, so I build a keep, and use my peasant at
                my 2nd gold mine to build a stable, first structure at that mine.
                Azure expands about this time south of himself.
                (Azure = oragne, I=yellow, chrism=red, shlong = green)
                Azure goes for flying machines to check the othermines out, tho I've 
                ot footmen at the other 2 to watch.  No sign of expansion on their
                parts.  I start building knights, and start a town hall at my 2nd mine
                (white).  Still no signs of expansion.  My 11 knights are starting
                to get antsy, but we figure, why move if we have more money?
                I stash a couple of barracks at purple, and then we notice red moving
                to blue.  We immdeiately move to attack, although he holds us off for
                a while.  <BR><BR>Shlonglor's bloodlusted ogres present aproblem, but
                shlonglor hasn't expanded, so we figure he will run out of money soon.
                We finally kick red out of blue's mine, while gren attacks my camp at purple,
                which has only 2 barracks.  His ogres soon slaughter my knights, but
                by now, our overwhelming money is starting to show, and we manage to
                kill all of green's troops.  Red has a few left, but those are minor.
                Green's last offensive is to my mine at white, which has run dry
                at this time.  I forget to pay attention to my gold, and can't build
                a town hall at purple, so I start sending peons between white and purple,
                but before I get the money, they surrender.  YAHOO! :)<BR><BR>
                We each get 2 points for beating them.
                We have to rematch them soon, however, and will probably lose those points
                back, but oh well.  It was fun getting them.<BR><BR><font color=red><b>Marshall</b></font>
