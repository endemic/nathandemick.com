<font color=00cc66><center><b>Game 1: Fierce Ocean:</b></font></center><p>

Well me and Cadaver were messing around. We had a few failed games
because of people dropping. We found one person with a stable
connection. We were of course playing under Fake names. We finally
convinced Cadaver to try it out :). Well Cadaver was serving it and
it was Mage and Gar. We finally decided on Fierce Ocean Combat.<p>

The game started. I was purple, Cadaver White, Gar Red, and Mage blue.
For some reason, I thought It was High Seas, but then I figured it out.
DOH fierce Ocean. That is when I realized I was screwed. Gar and Mage
were right above me and Cadaver was in the very bottom. I also knew Gar
was Good. Well I was purple, the worst Color on the map. See purple has
no where to build. And everything on that Island can be hit by the sea.
So I knew we had to win the sea or I was dead. Well we started out. I
told Cadaver to send his ships to me, because I knew they would attack
me first. I scouted with my first Oil Tanker. I saw that Gar's rig was
almost done, so I knew I was screwed. Just then on or more battleships
started killing my peons chopping. <b>Purple SUCKS!</b> I sent up 2 of
my Juggs and 1 of Cadaver's came. There was a transport on the shore and
I sank it. I'm not sure if it was empty or not. We lost the ship battle.
So Gar's battleships started like hitting my whole town.<p> 

Just then I was invaded by some footman and a peasant. It was Gar.
I didn't even have a barracks up yet so I went down. Gar built a couple
of towers in my town and like killed all my peons. I thought that was my
trick! But I was able to build a transport and escape with some peons. I
set up a new town on Yellow's island. Cadaver invaded old island on
Purple with the hopes of saving it but went down vs the towers. I think
he might have invaded it again, but like how would I know, I got kicked
off the island :) Well the island still had my 2 shipyards, 4 farms, 
and foundry. Cadaver protected the Shipyards for me with Juggs. Someone
attacked them with Subs, but Cadaver quickly came and saved them.<p>

Well I started my life over again, in a new town. Yellow's :)<br>
I had just built some stuff when I saw Gar fly over. I knew I was
screwed so I farmed in a tower and built some Grunts. I upgraded the
grunts. I was able to upgrade to stronghold. I started pumping out the
ogres. I got a flying machine too. I saw red on blacks island. Just a
few Knights there. I guess he had a town hall there but Cadaver got rid
of it :) What a great teammate, invades my island to save it, saves my
shipyards, gets a new island and still has time to invade Gar. Well
I decided it was pay back time. I loaded some Grunts and Ogres in a
transport and headed to Gar's Original Island. I guess he had the same
plans. He loaded his knights in a transport and headed to my new island.
Well I landed on his, went in and attacked the stables. I'm not sure if
he had peasants there at the time or not. If he did, I killed them :)
So then Gar lands on my island. Luckily, I had enough ogres to take care
of him. So I got rid of the stuff on Gar's island. I guess he was dead
at that point. He said something like, nice recovery. That is when I
told him who we really were. I probably wouldn't have if we lost :)
Gar was full of questions after that. I didn't want to answer. I was too
busy having fun.<p>

I upgraded my ships to level 5 and started whipping out
the Juggs. I then noticed that Mage (Blue) had Aqua's island. I went in and
killed some peons and knights. I informed Cadaver. He went in too. I
landed another load of Ogres, this time with Bloodlust. I bloodlusted
some of Cadaver's Ogres and we went in. Hey bloodlust for all I say.
That's what friends are for :) so we quickly cleaned out that island.
I then went in with my ships but they kept getting killed by Blizzard.
Well then we invaded. I sent in 2 transports and Gar sent in one. We
killed everything. Mage then surrendered.<p>

Next version:<p>

I got into a game with *Mage* as my partner, playing 2 wannabe Transformers
Optimus and Bumblebee, who turned out later to be Cadaver and Shlonglor in
disguise.  What a surprise!  I thought these would be newbies so I wanted
high resources in the chatroom, but we played medium on Fierce Ocean
anyways.  It started out with me and *Mage* planning our strategy.  I was
red and he was blue, opposite top corners, and Shlonglor was purple, in
between us.  He became our target.  I built as fast as I could, churning out
peasants and I made 2 battleships.  I went for his base while I built a
barracks and a transport.  But I went to the wrong side, and as I was away,
3 of Shlong's Juggs blasted my ship buildings and even shot my transport.  I
built some footmen and, after building another transport, landed 5 of them
and 1 peasant at his base.  His peasants were slaughtered quickly as my
peasant set up 2 guard towers.  His base went down fast, and I began to
wonder if he'd gotten off safely.  I upgraded and got some knights and
flying machines, and it turned out he had escaped, and his partner Cadaver,
who was white, also had a second town.  Great, I thought.  My partner was
just expanding too, and I tried to, but Cadaver landed six ogres and
attacked my lone town hall and 8 peasants.  So much for that!  It didn't
take long after that for then to beat me to the ground.  In the end, I
watched *Mage* blizzard their ships for a while until they landed ogre
forces with bloodlust and took him out, leaving me with only one tower at
Shlong's starting position.  We went to kchat to talk about stuff, and
agreed to play again...<p>

<font color=00cc66><b>Game 2: Plains of Grunts on low:</b><p></font>
</center>

Well we decided to play a land level. Mage was crying for one. Cadaver
wanted land too. Me, I'm satisfied to play water only. Well we picked
plains of snow on low. I was Yellow, Cadaver black, Gar orange and Mage
blue. I built my stuff fairly quick I thought. I got a load of grunts
and went in on Mage. He didn't have that much of defenses. I was like
level 3-4 he was level 2. I took his guys down and worked on his
peasants. I killed tons of them. I then destroyed his town hall.<p>

Sometime around then, Cadaver told me that his invasion of Gar had
failed and he was in trouble. So I sent all my grunts to his town. 
I upgraded and got a few Ogres. Just then Gar came in with lot's of
Ogres. We fought him. I think we fought them off. Then I sent everything
I had against blue again. I got rid of his hall again. Just then Cadaver
was attacked again. I sent all my stuff to him, but I couldn't fight all
those Ogres. I put up a new hall at white. Just before that, Mage came
in with a ton of footman. I guess he had them somewhere else the whole
time. Well I would have saved my town if that stupid peon would have
thrown the farm up. But he didn't. All I needed was a farm to block
myself in, then a tower would have saved me. BUT the peon didn't build
it. So I had to fight off a million footman. I finally fought them off.
But Mage killed all my peons. I think that lost the game for us. I got
my new town rolling. I got a flying machine and flew over Cadaver's
town. The whole place was on fire with a bunch of Ogres in it. I knew we
were dead. So Orange sends in the Ogres to my new town. I sent up mine
and I killed the Ogres. But he killed most of my peons. I tried
rebuilding them but a bunch of ogres came in again and I had 0 money and
not much of a defense. I died and so we lost the game. At least
I got rid of my enemy :) I took mage pretty much out of the game. He had
a few farms and a tower left.<p>

Next Version:<p>

After dragging Shlonglor away from his conversation with Marshall, we
started a game of low resources plains of snow, no attacking until mages.
Just kidding.  I was orange, *Mage* was blue, Cadaver black, and Shlong
yellow.  *Mage* and I built as fast as possible, knowing that Shlong and
Cadaver would attack quickly with grunts.  I was feeling good, and had loads
of peasants when Cadaver showed up with about 5 or 6 grunts.  However, I had
10.  I beat down his attack and had five still standing, so I moved in and
killed all his peasants.  At the same time, *Mage* and Shlong crossed paths
and killed each other's peasants.  I was the only one with lots of men.  I
kept producing grunts and I tried to hit Cadaver again, but Shlong was there
with some aid, so I killed some of them.  About this time, my guys were
level 5 and I was producing ogres.  I moved to purple's spot and built a
town hall, 3 guard towers, lumber mill, and a barracks.  I waited till I had
about 15 ogres and hit Cadaver with 9.  That did him in.  Or so I thought.
I made 2 alchemists(since I had the resources) and made flying machines.
Cadaver had a new mine at green, but it had little there.  4 ogres knocked
him out of the running for good. Then I saw Shlonglor's outpost, at white.
I ran in on his five ogres with nine of mine, and killed his peasants.  At
that point, Cadaver told me they'd surrender.  This was the highpoint of my
War2 career.  Although *Mage* only had a peasant and some farms in the end,
without his initial attack on Shlonglor, I couldn't have won.  I just built
a little faster, that's all. After that, we agreed to play one more.

<b>Game 3: Plains of Grunts on low:</b><p>
</center></font>

After the loss, we wanted a rematch.
I was stuck with Yellow again. Gar was white, Cadaver blue, Mage red.
We wised up this game. We decided to gang up on Gar super early. 
We had it planed out
exact. We built our barracks kind of early. I knew what would happen.
We would both go in on Gar, then Mage would attack and kill Cadaver's
peons. Well that is what happened. Cadaver got to Gar earlier then I
did. Cadaver's guys were almost dead by the time I got there. But with
my load of Grunts, Gar was dead. I kept killing Gar's Grunts as they
popped out. I killed his peons on gold and wood too. I saw a peon run
off. I knew he was heading for another town. So I sent 2 grunts to check
all the mines. I found Gar's new town in Purple. I informed Cadaver and
started taking the peons and hall at Purple. I sent another Grunt up
there and finished off everything.<p>

Well Like we thought, Mage attacked Cadaver. I guess he fought it off
but he needed help. I sent about 6 Grunts to Cadaver. Well he fought Mage
off himself. So I went down to Mage. I passed a block of about 9+
footman. I knew Mage was getting powerful. Well I knew all those Grunts
were dead so I tried to get a look at Mage's village. I got a good
enough look to see Mage was powerful. So I started making the Ogres big
time. I got a new hall set up at blacks spot. I sent in my Ogres and
attacked all Mage's footman. I got a bunch of them. I then sent in some
more, Mage sent off a bunch of peons, I chased and killed some, but most
got away. It was then I found Mage's second town. I sent up 4 or so
Ogres, and started killing his peons. It was then I see Mage's flying
machine over my new hall. I knew exactly what was coming. I sent over 2
Ogres to protect my hall QUICK. 
Just then 2 knights of Mage's attacks my peons. But my Ogre's
killed them. hahahaha.<p>

Well Cadaver was pretty much out of the game since he had been attacked
by Mage. He finally started making the Ogres. I sent in a bunch of Ogres
to Mage's original town with Bloodlust. Cadaver came in too. We took the
town down fast. Just then I found Mage had another town in Purple's
Spot. I informed Cadaver but I sent everything up there quick because I
wanted the kills :). I bloodlusted and we killed him.<p>

Now that was a good game. Good because we won, and I was the most
dominant player again. It's rare that I beat out my teammate. That's
because I always pick teammates who are better then me :)<p>

Gar's Version:<p>

Same settings, scene, and teams.  I was white, Shlong yellow, Cadaver blue?,
and *Mage* red?.  It started out like the last one, except when I had 5
grunts, about 12 of Shlong's and Cadaver's combined walked into my base.
This time, they wanted me gone early.  I couldn't do much of anything, my
peasants were killed, except for 2 who ran to purple to start over, but were
soon found by one of Shlong's grunts.  I tried to rebuild a little at my
home base, but there was no hope.  It started to get late, and *Mage* was
slowly dying, so I surrendered so I could go to bed.  All together, this was
the most enjoyable and challenging night of my life!  Things can't get much
better!<p>

<font color=red><b>Gar</b></font><p>

Cadaver's Version:<p>

Me(Cadaver) and Shlonglor had played GAR and *mage* twice already, and we
beat them on Fierce Ocean Combat, but then lost on Plains of Snow.  Not
believing that I had lost on Plains, I said to Shlonglor, 'we gotta do this
again.'  So we did, and I was blue.  *Mage* was red, Shlonglor was yellow
and GAR was white.  Since GAR had really kicked our asses in the game before
this one, we decided to double him early.  We were playing on low resources,
so it took while, but I built the barracks after the third farm.  I
immediately built a grunt, and then built another farm and a second
barracks.  When I had 4 grunts, I walked them over to GAR and killed 4 or 5
of his guys, and Shlonglor killed his peasants.  
<p>
        Now up until now, the plan was working flawlessly.  I had 2 barracks
pumping grunts, so I went ahead and built a smith and kept on training.  I
had 6 or so when *mage* walks his guys into my base.  Well, I killed off the
first wave, and I was thinking, can I handle this after giving up four
grunts early?  I thought I could, but the second rush came almost right
after the first, and I had only 2 grunts (level 1 mind you) against like 4
level 3 grunts.  So I lost, and he started killing my peons.  I ran enough
of them away, and built a hall in orange's spot.  I finally beat red out of
my town, with help from Shlonglor.  I didn't really know what he was doing,
but he told me *mage* was really powerful now, and that I should look out.
Well, this not being exactly what I wanted to hear, I just built a crapload
of grunts, and upgraded to level 4.  (I had been upgrading, but can't
remember when.)  When I had about 12 or so, I decided maybe I better go
attack.  I ran into *mage*'s base, to find it completely undefended.  I
figured he was off persecuting Shlonglor, so I took the opportunity to kill
off one of his 2 barracks.  Then about 5 or so red footmen come in, and I
kill them off, and start hitting the second barracks, since his peons were
walled in.<p>

About this time a bunch of knights come in and killed off my guys.  Oh well I
say, he still hasn't found my other base, and I have upgraded to stronghold.
So I train a few more grunts, then I get ogres.  A single knight wandered
into my base at orange...and I had to run guys from my base at blue to kill
him.  How pathetic huh?  But I killed it, and I only lost one peon.  Well I
kept training ogres, and then GAR says 'Well, nice playing guys' and I'm
like..'What?'  We had beaten him out!  Well, Shlonglor had anyway.  I had
just kinda saved my own butt.  But then I run to red's main base and start
to kill stuff, and Shlonglor is already there, so I join in.  We kill one
more secondary town and that's it.<p> 

        I can't believe we won this game.  We were so far down, and yet we
came back.  The moral is: never give up early!<p>
