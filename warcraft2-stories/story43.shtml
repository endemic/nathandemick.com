Well, the new patch is just incredible. The color randomization is
just great, but I'm starting to believe that isn't the best thing
about it, 8-player games are just so cool! So many things can be
done with 8 players! And as I'm about to tell you, some REALLY weird
things can happen too..<p>

As is usual lately, we the ShadowKnights (yeah, us silly guys with
the {{}} around our names) were hanging around in castle and after
much ado (I think we spend more time talking than playing.. hehe, 
I used to hate irc..) we finally set up a game. The players were
some of the SKs: Dragonlord, Demonlord, Ashton, TaiwanJK, Osric and 
me (Ayyo), plus the non-SK RTM^ and Kng.<p>

It seems Osric was somewhat impatient, because he went to host the
game real suddenly and catched us all by surprise, so we didn't
follow him right away. It was then that Dragon said: 'let's all
be {{Osric}} in the game.' He he, he must be somewhat nuts, and 
the rest of us must be too, because we all thought it was a good 
idea. So we went to Osric's game, being Osric! Here is a screen 
shot of the chatroom so that you can have an idea what was going 
around.<p>

Things were fun even in the chatroom. Imagine: 8 of us and we
all were Osric and nobody new who was each Osric. We all typed
some nonsense like: 'no matter what happens, I'll win', 'hey, nobody
knows who I'm, I can have a crappy game and noone will know!' (I 
think that was Dragon, but I'm not sure). As can be expected, 
there wasn't much effective communication but we all finally 
agreeded to a FFA, since everybody wanted to team up with Osric.
<p>
Well, we played garden on high, and the game was very interesting
and fun, even without the Osric stuff, as can be expected from an
8 player ffa. But us all bein Osric gave the game a whole new
dimension, the whole game was filled with nonsense messages like:
'hey Osric, want to double-team on Osric?', 'Osric, you are going 
DOWN!', 'I'm grunt rushing Osric', 'ok, I'll help', 'damn! Osric is
grunt rushing me!', 'Osric, take your sorry flyer away from me!',
'hey, who was that? was that you Osric' You get the picture.
<p>
We never revealed who each of us were, not til the end when only
Jimmy and .. Demon? were still playing. Much of the time
I didn't know what was happening besides what was happening to me.
I was red on blue's spot, and I decided I should take care of the
Osric who was on red's spot first. Red's spot on garden is no good,
since you can get at the mining peasants with a tower on the other
side of the wood. I walled myself in and made 2 or 3 grunts, and
sent the peasant to make the tower. Aqua, who was on red's spot, 
quickly sent some grunts to try to dispose of it. It was a close
fight, but I managed to upgrade and keep the tower alive, and that
did it for Aqua, whose line dropped a bit after that. I was very 
lucky to pull that off. I was feeling very happy since now I could 
get that mine. I thought I ought to do the same to yellow, who was on
blue's spot, so I sent the peasant to make the tower, but Yellow
already had a tower by his mine, and my peasant got killed. Me, 
feeling very brave, made a catapult and sent it there, along with
some grunts and ogres (yeah, it was ogre time by then) to protect
it, but yellow, who I later found out was the mighty Dragon, 
had lots of ogres who quickly disposed of my forces. I was quite 
scared since he took those ogres and headed to my town, and I had
very few defences. When he was about and inch from my town, he 
dropped! That saved me. Had he dropped half a minute later, I
would have been killed for sure. Well, that left JK, Demon, Osric
and me, since RTM^ had dropped early in the game. I don't really 
know what happened after that. I upgraded and got bloodlust and a 
few death knights, and either someone got Osric or he dropped. 
I started a second town on reds spot and I was attacked by Demon,
whose town was on white, but I had enough forces to fight him off. 
Then I finally started exploring (very late, I know) and found out 
JK, whose town was on black, had started a second town on organge's 
spot so I sent a couple of death knights and death and decayed his 
peasants. I think the whole time he and Demon were fighting, 
and spent all their forces killing each other. Demon and JK 
surrendered then..
<p>
A very fun game it was! and I was very lucky Dragon dropped when he
did (hehe) and that nobody payed much attention to me.
<p>
A weird, weird game. so who won? Osric did.<p>
