You would think with all this attention the War 2 Whore Silverwolf
would change his ways wouldn't you? Nope, he's still whoring
along. Here is some more stories.<P>

Silverwolf, the War 2 whore was sitting in kchat trying to
get a 8 player game of nowhere 3 together. When the teams
were choosen, none of which was me, they said head to War 2. I
quickly busted it into the game. It was supposed to be
Maddawg, Doomgaze, Beowulf and the War 2 Whore, but when they
saw me, Maddawg quickly grabbed me for his team. What was funny
was the War 2 whore didn't get into the game in time and he
lost his spot. hahahah. Yeah booted the whore outta his own game!
hahahah. But one of the laggers dropped out of the chatroom and
Silverwhore made it in. DOH! Maddawg chooses the teams agian,
Me, Maddawg, Doomgaze and the War 2 whore. Doh the Whore!!
How could we win with the Whore? Is it possible?<P>

We started off on nowhere. You can check the map on the puds page
if you don't know it. As it turned out, we were all side by
side. Doomgaze was on the very left, then Maddawg next to
him, me right of maddawg and Silverwhore right of me. Right next
to the Whore how lovely. haha.<P>

We get going along, I chop into maddawg. The plan was for me and Maddawg
to go up to Ogres while the Whore and Doomgaze rushed. There was some
confusion over where the whore actually was. He didn't know the
common way of telling where you start. He said some shit like bottom lower
right. But there are 2 positions that can start there. So I figured he
wasn't smart enough tell where he actually was. Later when
we explained how you properly tell where you are in whore langauge, 
we confirmed the whore was next to me..<P>

I started one peon chopping toward the whore. When I first saw his
peons I said to everyone, "I see whore peons!" hahah. He tried to
come back with some like lame comeback, I see fag peons. Pathetic, a
comeback worthy of the War 2 whore.<P>

I was going along. I think I was still building my 2nd or 3rd farm
when the whore goes I'm chopped into the enemy? WTF? I didn't even
have any guys. Even if I would have been going Rush I wouldn't have
had any guys yet. Thats the whores strategy. Open up when you got
nothing for defense hahaha.<P>

I was going along, I had a mill and 3 farms or so when the whore
starts yelling about all these grunts in his town. He says they are
sending peons too. Well this is to be expected. The whore always
goes down. So
