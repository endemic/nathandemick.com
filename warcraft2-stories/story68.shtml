I was digging through my screenshots and I just couldn't let these ones
slide....<P>

Gotcha and I were in Kchat when Backlash says, he thinks he is going to go
play a 1on2. So Gotcha and I figured, hahaha wouldn't it be the ultimate
to Smurf Backlash? hahah. So we join a game, and I think backlash was in it.
I forget, this was 3 months ago. I think I said, everyone go to my game, I'll
serve. Gotcha and I made it in, and Backlash game in too. I asked Backlash
what he wanted to play. I was hoping to trick him into saying, he wanted a
2on1 with him vs me and Gotcha hahaha. But another person joined and
he decided 2on2 would be fine. The server was Starlink so I figured I might
be able to pick FOC on Low without fear of him smelling smurf. He
agreed that FOC was fine. But, the way it was lined up, the teams, I was
on Backlash's team and Gotcha on the other guys team. DOH. Well we were
prepared to pull some seriously low crap, not like we don't do it all the
time anyway, :) but Backlash asks what the teams were. I said that other guy
was on his team....<P>

So we got going. I was Yellow, Gotcha, I think was aqua, or orange, I forget.
That one guy was White, and Backlash was red. We did the usual deal, we
were playing at our peaks knowing it was backlash. I got a few walled
in towers super early. We both started pumping Juggs. Gotcha and I were
able to quite easily over come Backlash's fleet 2on1. Back's teammate didn't
really do jack sheet. We then discovered that Backlash was pulling his famous
strat of getting two second mines at once. He was trying for one at
Blue and one at Black. He was walling in a tower when I sent in my Cat and
a few grunts. But, Gotcha's Juggs around the corner got his tower. I
went in and set up. Thanks for the mine. Gotcha towered his way into
Backlash's other new town on Black. He built towers on the shore and
didn't stop until there was a ton of towers all over his island. We
flew over his town and noticed he didn't even have a barracks, if he did, it
looked like he built it only recently. It was around that point he says:
"Ok good game guys, wish I had a teammate." haha We noticed his little newbie
teammate was building Subs, Destroyers and actually made 1 or 2 Juggs by
the time. We made quick work of him.<P>

Smurfed!<P>

I then sent Backlash a Mail telling him he got his ass smurfed by the
one and only team of Gotcha and Shlonglor. Here was his reply:<P>

<font color=00cc66><b>
You Punks!  You shoulda told me you were playing, i woulda got BuYah to
play on my team, he can't swim too well, but at least he's dependable...
<P>

Just when we thought our luck couldn't get any better....<P>

Shaf and I decided to Smurf on Starlink. I was serving a game of
Spiral on Low when look who walks in. Backlash, buhahhahahahahaha!<P>

I got Blue, Shaf Red, Backs partner gets Orange and Backlash got Purple.
hahaha. Well for some reason, I did like the best building I've ever
done before on sea. I had 2 Juggs in on Backlash before he even had one.
By the time I had the 2 down there, I had 2 more coming. I was able to
overcome backlash, but Shaf came in later on and helped me seal the deal.
Shaf invaded backlash with some footmen and a Catapult. But using bad control, his catapult charged Backlash's tower, and it got killed. His invasion failed.
Backlash tried to snag oil up top right and another shipyard, but we
were too smart for that. The whole time, Backlash's newbie teammate was playing
Sim City. haha. We both invaded Backlash with Sappers and such..<P>

It was about then I said: "Does anyone Smell Smurf?" hahaha. Backlash goes: "
Shlonglor?" haha. We then spilled the beans. He was like, DOH that's
2 times now. After those 2 times, it was bugging the hell out of Backlash.
He wanted to regain his honor by a fair 1on1 between me and him, but that's
not the way I operate. haha I play unfair.<P>

In Backlash's defense, both times he got stuck with full on newbies for
teammates, and both times it was 2on1, but that doesn't change the
fact he got smurfed twice by Shlonglor :)<P>

What's really funny is Backlash is probably way the heck better then
I am. At least on land for sure. We never got a chance for a fair matchup
on sea. And I think I'll keep it that way :)<P>
