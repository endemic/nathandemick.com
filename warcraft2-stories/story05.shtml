After YingYang, Clay, and beta lost, (See the High Seas Combat Story)
they wanted a rematch. We gave it to them. It was 3 on 3 again on the
No where out of this maze map. I was white, Gotcha was Orange, Beta was
blue, Clay was Aqua, YingYang was black and Tou was
red, the worst position. Poor Tou. He always has to be red on
that level. haha.<p>

Well I'm not sure what happened in the beginning. I
really did not watch too closely. I started out by walling my self in.
I built tons of peons. I was rolling in the money and
lumber. Since I had so much money, I built tons of arrow towers in my
town. Gotcha walled himself in too I think. I think the first thing that
happened was everyone attacked Tou. Me and Gotcha were either walled in
our we had nothing to help. So Tou got attacked bad. I chopped my way
out of my town. I sent a flying machine over beta's town and saw he only
had about 3 Ogres. So I sent all mine in. But he had way more than I
expected. There was a lot more Ogres than I had. He must have hidden them
somewhere. So I lost that battle. I called for Gotcha for help. I made a
bunch more Ogres and me and Gotcha both invaded Beta. We took him out. I
got the bloodlust and that finished him. I stayed around and finished
him off.<p>

While that was going on, Tou kept typing "help help." I sent over
some guys and did not find anyone in Tou's village. So I headed over to
Ying's second town. I killed a lot of his peons but he whipped out the
Death Knight. That guys is the king of the Death Knights. He Death and
Decayed all my guys. I think 2 Survived. Just then, Clay came in and
took my 2 guys out. That was the last time I remember Tou being alive.
I'm really not sure what happened to him. Someone invaded him and I
guess being the nice teammates we are, me and Gotcha did not help Tou.
By that time, I chopped through to the top right mine. I made my town
hall there. I had so much money that I made about 5 barracks. I was
making guys in them constantly the whole game. Me and Gotcha massed tons
of guys and went in on Clay. Gotcha went first and got wasted. I went in
and lost my guys too due to Death and Decay. I then went in on Clay from
the top. I happened to find about 7 of his Death Knights. I killed them
all after losing tons of my Ogres. I went in and attacked Blacks two
barracks in the middle of nowhere too. Then I guess Gotcha got invaded
by Yingyang. I think he lost tons of stuff in his town. I just remember
him saying he is screwed. So I went in and saved his blacksmith. That
kept Gotcha in the game. By that time, Tou was just a wanderer. He had a
few peasants, a flying machine and a some farms left. He was really good
in telling us where the enemy was and what they were doing. That is why
you stay in the game till you are elminated. I had mined out my second
mine so i went to another one.<p>

At that time, it was just me vs Beta,
Clay and Ying. Gotcha was screwed and Tou was pretty much eliminated.
I was taking them all on and winning! That allowed Gotcha to recover.
Tou kept typing to me "Blue, Beta, has a new town right below yours.
Attack now he is defenseless." So thanks to Tou, I went in on Beta's town.
He had most of it rebuilt at his new mine. It only took 4 bloodlusted ogres to
beat him. His teammates never came to help. I cleared out blues stuff
with the help of Gotcha and then Gotcha took that mine. Then YingYang
came in and Death and Decayed all my peons mining. He killed them all. 
So I got my peons rolling again. Then I got another mine in the bottom
right corner. I was mining 2 at once. I kept sending in guys to Clay. 
I had those 5 barracks remember? I sent in tons of guys at a time. They
would all die. Tou kept typing "They are really hurting for money." I
guess they were. Gotcha the Mage master kept attacking Clay.
I think Gotcha was finally able to beat all of Clays guys. I went in and
helped him. Beta had a few farms and stuff left in Clays town, so Gotcha
killed them off. That eliminated Beta. That was good because Beta kept
ratting us out. Clay was pretty much screwed so he abandoned his teammat
e and left the game. So it was just me and Gotcha vs YingYang. Tou was still
around with just his farms. I think. Tou had sent in all his pesants and
took out a bunch of Clays Death Knights I believe. Clay did not seem too
happy to get hs Death Knights taken by peasants. haha. So that left Ying
Yang. He put up quite a fight. We both had trouble with him. It took a
bunch of Ogres and Death Knights to finally beat him. He is good.<p>

We finally won. That game was the best ever. What was so cool was that
Me and Gotcha took on 3 and won. Tou because of his poor position, red,
got screwed. I really liked that I was able to take on all 3 by myself.
That made YingYang and Clay to admit that me and Gotcha are good. They
must have thought when they got rid of Tou, that they had won. They had
a sure thing. BUT they did not count on how good me and Gotcha really
are, of course with Tou's scouting help. We were really mean to Tou that
game. We didn't really help him and we made fun of him being eliminated.
haha. We will do better next time at that. YingYang said something like,
"So this is what it feels like to lose 2 in a row." haha. That was the
most fun i've ever played. It went like 2+ hours.<p>

So Tou won in the end. With his farms. It was so funny. He types "man
i'm sure sick of staring at my farms." haha. I said "Those farms really
helped us. They were pumping out those chickens." haha.<p>
