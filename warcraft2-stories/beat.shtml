<center><h2>Some games I've lost.</h2></center>
<b>Last Updated 6/21/97</b><p>

At the time I made this page, back in 3/13/96 this was ALL the games
I had lost from 12/14/96-3/13/96. For 2-3 months, in 100s of games, I
had only lost this many below. I was awesome back then :)<P>

<hr size=2 width=90%>
<center><font size=+2>Anarchy, Free for all games.</font></center>
<hr size=2 width=90%>
<ul>

<li><b>Warpmaster</b> vs some guy vs Me. Warpmaster is my roommate. 
That guy and Warpmaster decided to team up 
on me in a 2 vs 1 game. Not too fair. It was my first loss and my first
realization that my roommate warpmaster is a dirty guy. Warpmaster
teamed up with the guy to kill me and then when that guy attacked Warp, Warp
then killed him too. What a jerk!<p>

<li><b>Gold Dragon</b>. It was a 1 on 1 game I think. It was one of my first
games. He came in early and killed ALL my peasants. Being the idiot
newbie that I was, I spent money on a knight instead of a peasant and
spent all my money. That left me with no money for a peasant and no way
to get the money since my peasants were all dead. What an idiot newbie
mistake.<p>

<li><b>Jowfus.</b> It was a 3 player game. I went in early and totally 
erased this guy from the map. That left Jowfus. But this was my first
exposure to the Bridge to Bridge map. I did not know anything about how
the AI gets so screwed on that level. So after tons of repealed
invasions, Jowfus finally made it in and destroyed me.<p>

<li><b>Warpmaster.</b> It was a three way ship battle with really good
players. Me, Jowfus and Warpmaster and It was totally anarchy. I won the
sea in the beginning. Warp hid out like he always does on three player
games. Then when the fighting was over, me and Jowfus discovered that
Warp owned all the islands on Fierce Ocean Combat. That left both us
with no Gold. We allied against Warp but It was no good. He had all the
gold. What a jerk, hahaha.<p>

<li><b>Warpmaster yet again.</b> It was another 3 way battle on the
Spiral. I invaded
and almost killed warp, I beat him off the sea pretty much. Then I went
in and killed off the navy of the other player. I invaded the other
player and wasted him. I then went back to warp but It was too late. He
had rebuilt his navy and it was way better than mine. He won a series of
ship battles. Then I made another town hall on another island. I invaded
warps new islands. The he invaded mine. The only problem was that he
destroyed my town hall and I did not have enough lumber to build
another. All the lumber was gone on my island. Also he sank my transport
and he owned the sea so there was nothing I could do. That pissed me off
so bad. If it were a 1 on 1 game I could have totally killed warp. I out
played him so bad in that game and he won. All because I was stupid.
That made me so mad that I challenged him to a 1 on 1 IWL match. I
thrashed him bad in two 1 on 1 games and kicked him down the ladder in our
IWL clan. Hahahahha. Isn't revenge grand?<p>

<li><b>Gotcha.</b> Warps brother and my roommate also. We were playing a
team game. It was me and Gotcha vs 3 others. It was plains of snow. 
Two of other player's towns were on both sides of Gotcha's town. At the
beginning of the game he said to me, "You have to protect me." I said
"nope you are all on your own." I was only joking! Gotcha took me
seriously. So he got a huge group of footman and instead of attacking the
enemy, he attacked me!!!!!!!! His own teammate. I was so mad that I
exited the game as soon as he started killing my peasants. I could have
fought him, but I was too mad. So the enemy was totally surprised. They
said Why did Shlonglor leave? My revenge was watching him lose to the
other enemy players. We are roommates so I watched him play on his
computer. He lost! It was so awesome! Perfect pay back. The enemy said
"Too bad Shlonglor left." I said to Gotcha "Too bad that you did that to me, we
could have won but now you lost, hahahahhaha."  Man I sure can't trust
my roommates. Back-stabbing runs in the family. I still owe him for
that.<p>

<li><b>Derek Stowe.</b> I made the mistake of played at about 4:30 a.m.
I was stoned out of my mind (tired). I really did not expect him to be
so good. I have to admit that I could have done lots of things to beat
him but being so stoned I really could not think straight. He was really
good though. I made 4 barracks and was constantly making guys. He had
like 2-3 and He was out guying me! I still can't figure out how he did
it. No matter how many guys I would send in, he would always have more.
He just wasted me. I set up 2 other towns but He found them both. That
is the last time I play a game after 3:00 a.m. I asked for a rematch for
revenge. We played Plains of Snow. I totally wasted him. That is pay back
enough for me.<p>

<li><b>G-man.</b>  1 on 1. I made the mistake of playing G-Man on his level,
Gold separates, on
high resources. He knows that level so well. He came in early with like
a million footman and wasted me. End of story.<p>

<li><b>G-man again.</b> It was a day where I had lost 3 games that day.
one loss a week is a huge number for me but 3 that day! Earlier in the
week, I had beaten up G-man for his first victory over me, 
see above story for his first
victory. So it was him wanting revenge. I decided to pull the Barracks
first strategy on him. BUT he did the same thing. When my 3 grunts
attacked his 3 footman, All mine were killed and 2 of his survived. 
His 2 came in and attacked my town. I don't even think my town hall was
complete yet.  The game lasted about 2 minutes! Isn't that barracks first 
deal the absolute worst piece of crap strategy ever?<p>

<li><b>Storm Shadow.</b> It was a 1 on 1 game. Medium resources? Plains of
snow. I decided to build my barracks 3rd and go in early with 2 footman.
I think he did the barracks first strategy. That was way before I had
even heard about it. So I went in with two grunts expecting to only see
peasants but he had 4 footman! It was then that I and Gotcha figured out
the barracks first strategy. But don't blame us. We found out later that
people had already been using it. So I got wasted. The game lasted about
5-10 minutes. And to top it off, Storm would not give me a rematch
because he had to take off. I later got revenge on him in a team game,
haha. Watch out for Storm on bridge to bridge. Bridge to Bridge is to
StormShadow as Gold Separates is to G-man. Always avoid these levels
with those guys.<p>

<li><b>Zima</b> beat me 1 on 1. The map was plains of snow on medium
resources. I was trying some kind of lame wall in strategy. I had 4
grunts when Zima came in with his 4 grunts. Only my 4 grunts killed all
his grunts and he only killed 1. So I'm thinking, OK I got this game all
wrapped up. So I go to attack him with 4 grunts. He had 2 waiting and
through bad controlling or whatever, I lost all mine. He just had
completed a second barracks. I only had 1. Then I look at my resources,
I had like 4000 gold and like 450 lumber. So i made another barracks
only I accidently blocked it in so my grunts could not get out. I made a
bunch of grunts and went in on Zima again. He had just as many grunts
and was probably up to level 2. All my guys died. He then invaded me. I
had like 3 grunts. And I have about 2-3 stuck because, I accidently
blocked them in. His guys were level 3 and I still did not have a
blacksmith. I got wasted. I lost the game because, of poor controlling of
my grunts in the first invasion. Because I had only like 2 guys on
lumber and tons on gold. Because I blocked my barracks in. And because
Zima just played better than me. :( <p>

<li><b>Marshall</b> beat me 1 on 1. The map was plains of snow on high.
It was an IWL game. I went in with all my grunts early, and he not only
had as many grunts but he had more. His grunts killed like all my
grunts and mine killed like none of his, 
mostly because I did not control them at all. So he counter attacked. He
went right by my guys and attacked and killed my peons. I fought it off
and counter attacked. But he had walled his peasants in. So I had to
settle for attacking a barracks. But he started repairing it from the
other side. On top of that, he started to pump out knights. I think I
was still upgrading to Stronghold. Those knights just overpowered me.
Bye the time I started making Ogres, it was too late. On top of that, I
discovered he had another town. He must have built it pretty early. So
soon there was like a million knights in my town and I was dead. :(
<p>

<li><b>Dragonlord</b> beat me 1 on 1. The map was plains of mine the
center. I just did everything wrong. I survived and even could have
possibly won the game, but I didn't. Here was my mistake. I built my
barracks 3rd but then I walled in. Idiot!<p>

<hr size=2 width=90%>
<center><font size=+2>Team games.</font></center>
<hr size=2 width=90%>

<li><b>Muzzy and Vermeer</b> beat me and Warpmaster. Warpmaster and I
had played a long string of newbies that weekend. Never having seen
Muzzy or Vermeer, we thought they were just some more newbies. So I
really slacked off. I upgraded to Stronghold with only 6 peons. 
Don't do that! So I got way behind. I really did not do anything. I did not
make any towers or grunts or anything. So Vermeer came in early with 4
level 3 grunts and killed all my peons. I fought it off but I never
recovered. Muzzy came in with a ton of Ogres. Warp was able to protect
me from them. Then Muzzy got bloodlust and came in. There was no
stopping him. He was about to kill off my town when he dropped. To be
fair, I dropped out too. That left Warp with the puny humans vs
Bloodlusted, Vermeer's Ogres. Warp bit it big time. Since Vermeer and
Muzzy are so good, I got them into our IWL Orc clan. We are going to do
great things together. Just let me give you some advice: Always play
like your enemy is the best player ever. Also don't upgrade to keep without
having a bunch of peons.<p>

<li><b>Tou and Dirga</b> beat me and Gotcha. It was the Skull Isle map.
I did the barracks first deal. I made a barracks then a farm. But then
I discovered that I there was no room for my town hall!!! So I ended up
walking across the entire map looking for a new mine to build by. By the
time I set up my town, everyone already had their towns rolling. I got so far
behind there was no chance for me. But I think Tou did the same thing.
So Tou and Dirga pretty much took me out. Then Gotcha took out Tou.
Gotcha had that game all wrapped up BUT he let his guys get separated. 
But Gotcha thought it was 2 on 1. So he went up to the top left corner
to attack what he thought was Tou. He did not know Tou had been pretty
much eliminated. So he sent half his guys to Dirga's town and half to 
the Top left corner where Digra had lots of footman and a corner. If
Gotcha would have kept all his guys together and would have gone to
Dirga's town, He would have won. Just another one of Gotcha's bonehead
moves he pulls in team games. We pretty much wasted Tou and Dirga in the
Rematch game. I invaded Tou and took him out. Dirga sent in a bunch of
Gryphons into my town. He had to run away because I was wasting his
Gryphons. But then Dirga dropped. He would have lost, so I consider that
a win.<p>

<li><b>Tou and Chrism</b> beat me and Warpmaster. It was high seas. We
both invaded Tou and took him out. But we pretty much left Chrism alone.
Me and Warp played like a couple of idiots. It was 2 on 1 and Chrism
took us out. He is awesome! Chrism invaded my new town with Knights. He
took out all my Ogres and Berzerkers. Then He sent in like a million
Gryphons. He actually beat me and Warp with tons of Gryphons. I played
like an Idiot. Chrism beat us up bad. Tou was reduced to a transport and
one peon. It was really funny. He sent his peon to travel the world. He
visited each island and finally returned to the land of the peons birth.
The wandering peon. haha.<p>

<li><b>Tou and Chrism</b> beat me and Gotcha. It was Gotcha's pud
Whatkey. Gotcha decided to pull the build a bunch of Archers for no
reason. So Chrism invaded him with lots of footman and Wasted him. Tou
had a bunch of Level 4 Battleships. So we got screwed. Gotcha was
eliminated. Tou had to leave and he left the game. That left me vs
Chrism. I did pretty good. I think I could have won it but I did not
build, or rebuild my second town hall. Tou took out my first one. I let
my money run out and I ran out of money so I could not build another
town hall. That is like the 6th time I've done that. I'm such an idiot.<p>

<li><b>Whiplash and Cap'n'Jim</b> beat me and Warpmaster. I don't
remember much about that game. I just remember I built all wrong and
they kicked our ass for it. We played them again on Water, and
we thrashed them.<p>

<li><b>Claytonious and Ying Yang</b> beat me and Gotcha. It was another
game where I was bragging. Before we played the game, I pretty much
Guaranteed we would beat them. BUT they beat us up. And I mean BAD. They
just played with us like little kids. They would not even give us a
rematch, we played so bad. Clay made like a million Ogres and and so did
Ying Yang. It was Garden of War and I was white. Gotcha was yellow. Clay
sappered through to me on the left side and a ton of Ogres invaded my
town. They just thrashed me so bad. It ended up being Gotcha vs both of
them. He did pretty good but lost it. Man we felt like a couple of
newbies.<p>

<li><b>Claytonious and Ying Yang</b> beat me and Gotcha again. It was
the next night. The map was high seas. Clay sappered through to me and
invaded me with lots of Ogres. That screwed me over bad. Gotcha did
pretty good. He had to bail me out a lot. But Gotcha ran out of money
before building another town hall. He does that all the time. I think he
could have won if he would not have spent all his money before building
another town hall.<p>

Another loss. We were beginning to think we really
sucked. Then a week or so later, we got in a 7 player war 2 game. With
ALL direct connects. It was awesome. We played Fierce Ocean Combat.
It was Gotcha, Chrism, Tou and me
vs Clay, Beta and Felix. They had some idea that they would win. That
sure did not happen. We played again on Garden of War and beat them
again. Those really were not real wins because It was 4 vs 3 and one of
the 3 on Clay's side sucked.<p>

We got into a 3 on 3 game later that week. Me, Gotcha and Tou
won both of them vs Clay, Ying Yang and Beta. In the last game it was me
vs Clay, Ying Yang and Beta for a while before Gotcha could help out. We
won that and finally got Clay to admit that we, Gotcha and I, are
good. <br><a href="http://www.lighthousewc.com/fraizer/WAR2/STORY/story.shtml">Read
about those battles.</a> Read the High Seas Combat and the Rematch. Those
are the stories.<p>

<li><b>Moldy, Gob and Jake</b> Beat me and Warpmaster. We played on
Gotcha's Whatkey pud. I made the mistake of picking Warp for a partner.
Moldy and Gob came in and eliminated Warpmaster in like 3 seconds. I don't
know what was up with Jake. He was just this guy that lived in Gob and
Moldy's Dorm so they made us include him. Any way. I ended almost
beating them all. All three of them. I Invaded Gob, and thrashed on him. I
invaded Moldy and did pretty good. Then I made the mistake of Invading
Jake. I thought I was invading Moldy. I think the plan was just to let
Jake watch but the punk invaded me. He sent in a bunch of Gryphons and
I wasted him. Anyway it was 3 on 1. I kicked ass. If I would have played
that right, I could have won. I did not make another town hall for the
millionth time. I'm such an idiot. Well those guys left the game
thinking I could take them all on and win. So maybe that wasn't really a
loss. I could have taken on Moldy and Gob and won.<p>

<li><b>Gotcha and someone else</b> beat me and Moldy. I took out
Gotcha's partner and Gotcha took out mine. Then Gotcha sent in some
grunts really early and killed all my peons. That got me so far behind.
Gotcha came in and wasted me. I always lose on his pud.<p>

<li><b>Jff~~, Warhound, and someone else</b> beat me and Gotcha. It was
on Whatkey, Gotcha's pud again. It was 3 on 2. We beat the someone else
guy and he left. But in a 2 on 2 game, we lost it. We both tried to hold
the middle island.  We kept invading Warmonger over and over and we
could not win. It was another game where we played like idiots. It was
an even worse loss because Warmonger and Jff~~ are good players.
We ran out of money and lost. It seems I always lose on Gotcha's pud. I
don't think I'll play that again. It is a good pud. I just suck at
it.<p>


<li><b>5 players, one of which was Chrism,</b> vs me and Gotcha. We
really did not plan to play against 5 players. Normally about 3 drop and
it gets down to a 2 on 2 game. But not that game. It was the first game
where no one dropped. We did pretty good vs 5. We almost forced a
stalemate. They certainly did not have an easy time taking us out. We
did lose though. It was 2 on 5. Come on. If Chrism wasn't in it, I think
we could have won. That was before we knew that Chrism was good. We
kicked some serious ass for it being an 5 on 2 game. You got to give us
credit for doing such a good job vs 5 players. We got the juice, man!<p>

<li><b>Claytonious, YingYang, & Beta</b> beat me, Gotcha and Chrism. We
played the Maze. Me and Gotcha walled ourself in and Chrism did not. So
it ended up being Chrism vs all. Me and Gotcha could not get out to
help. You have to go one way or the other as teams. All wall in or all
not wall in. We discovered that today. To top it off, we played like
crap. oh well<p>

<li><b>Azure and Marshall</b> beat me and Chrism. It was all my fault. I
never got a second mine. So when I ran out of money, I was screwed. On
top of that, they double teamed Chrism and I really did not help much.
It was plains of Snow on high resources. I was Aqua. But they built a
barracks right above me in purples spot to makes sure I did not get a
mine. Well it worked. I was able to get rid of the forces guarding my 
mine in purples spot. But then they sent in like a million troops and
attacked Chrism. So we lost. It was all because of me. I boned it. :)
<p>

To read Marshall's version of the story
<a href="http://www.lighthousewc.com/fraizer/WAR2/STORY/story72.shtml"><b>go
here.</b></a> Look for Marshall and Azure vs Chrism and Shlonglor.<p>

<li><b>Pokerto and Jff~~</b> beat me and Gotcha. The map was High Seas
and it was medium Resources. Well I had some Juggs and I let them get
separated. So It was my 1 jugg vs 2 of pokerto's. So my Jugg went down.
When I sent my other up to help, it got sunk. After that, I was off the
sea. So then Pokerto invaded me. I eventually fought it off but not
before he killed a lot of my peons. So I got my peons rolling again and
he invaded again. I fought it off again but then he invaded for a third
time. I could not fight off that 3rd invasion. I had also built 2 Goblin
Alchemists. My plan was to sapper up to orange's town since I was Aqua.
I sappered through the rocks, but I never had enough money to build a
town hall up there. Gotcha did a bit better but he was taken down. A
really big smear.<p> 

BUT we did a rematch on that same level. Same
everything. But this time, me and Gotcha kicked some serious ass. So it
was 1 win and 1 loss. Good enough for me.<p>

<li><b>Jff~~ and Searon~~</b> beat me and Gotcha. The map was Garden of
War, medium resources. That was like the saddest game me and gotcha ever
played. We had like no kills. See we built a lot of grunts early. BUT,
we got lost in the garden, yeah I know, couple of idiots. By the time we
found the enemy's town, they already had some grunts and a tower. Then I
got the stupid idea of attacking the blacksmith. I thought If I could
get rid of the blacksmith, we could get them. I got the Blacksmith down
to like 40 or so hit points. When they killed all my grunts. So he just
repaired the blacksmith. A totally failed invasion. All my grunts killed
and I did not kill a single guy. So I sent in my next wave to Searon.
Gotcha's guys go lost on the way and it ended up being me by my self.
All my grunts got killed. After that It was all over. Suddenly I was
invaded by like 20 ogres. We lost that game BAD.<p>
