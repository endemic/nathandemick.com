You ever had one of those games where you just play unbelieveable good?
You just kick major ass and don't even screw up. Well this was my game.
But it didn't start out good.<P>

We were sitting around in kchat when Cadaver offered a 2on2 on Spiral low.
How could I refuse? It was to be again Termy and Barney. I really wanted
to kill me a big purple dino. So we started off. I got top left, blue.
Cadaver got red bottom right. One of them got middle bottom and the other
got top right.<P>

I started off. We agreed, Cadaver was going to take bottom oil right
of his island. I was to take oil above Cadaver, a nice safe place.<P>

I started off ok, but I walled myself in. That was my plan but I
accidently walled all my guys in. DOH. I couldn't even get out to build
my yard. Cadaver was building his yard. I had to chop 4 chops to get out.
But I had like 20 peons :) I built 2 yards at once. As it turns out, Cadaver
got his oil stolen. NEWBIE. hahah. I had 2 yards going at once with 2 peons
repairing at once. I made the mistake of putting BOTH yards too far from the oil. I made about 6 tankers. So I got up a refinery and put guys repairing it too.
Cadaver wasn't even on the sea. He was screwed. Around that time, in comes 
Red, with an invasion, Termy. BUT I had my entire town walled in. I also
had a guard tower. His Footmen killed a few of my peons that were chopping
on the outside but that's it. He walked all around and couldn't get in.
hahahahha. Gotcha said I should build a barracks. Shlonglor: "Barracks? I
don't need NO STINKIN BARRACKS!" hahahaha. I began to pump 2 juggs at
a time. They were almost instantly up to level 3. I pumped another 2, and
another 2, both at the same time. Termy had those footmen on the shore. I
snaged a few of them. I went around to the other side of my island and
got the others and the transport that was sitting on my island. I sent
3-4 Juggs on attacking Termy's yard and shipping operations. It was a Slaughter.I sent another 4 Juggs down to Cadaver, I took on blue's juggs too. He had
2 shipyards pumping them. I easily over came Barny's Juggs and killed his
oil rig allowing Cadaver to build a rig. I took BOTH of them by myself on
the sea. hahahaha.<P>

I quickly got up to Stronghold and found that Termy had the extra island.
He not only had it, it was HIS. There was a hall there, like 5 knights, 
Mage tower, walled in towers, The peons were walled in. It was secure. Well
you know what that means? MAGE TIME! But what to do with all those 9 Level
4 Juggs (2 cannon upgrades)? Why destroy blue's mine of course hahahahha.
<P>

<b>I attacked Barney's mine.</b></a><P>

The following has to be one of the funniest pictures. Check out Barney's
peons discovering there is no mine. "Isn't there supposed to be a mine here?"
<P>

<B>Where did the mine go?</b>
<br clear=left><p>

Cadaver at sometime invaded him. I was worried about Termy. He had 2 islands.
The first trick I pulled was, I sent in 1 sapper, he ran by 7 knights and
killed 2 Mages. hahahaha. I then landed a Mage on Termy's 2nd mine on his
main island. I Blizzarded his peons and got in the transport and ran.<P>

I then pulled one awesome manuever. I did the double Blizzard on Termy's
Knights killing all 7 Knights. 
<P>
Check out this animated Gif I made of of the
<a href="PICS/s75a.gif">
<b>Double Blizzard.</b></a> (Warning 226k)<P>

After the troops were gone, I walked in and Blizzard all the crap. Towers,
and everything.<P>

A while Later Cadaver invaded with Bloodlusted Ogres. I invaded too
with Mages. But Termy sent some Gryphons over to attack Cadaver. So, I
blizzard everyone. Gryphons, Towers, Cadaver, the whole lot. I think
only one Ogre of Cad's made it out. hahahah.<P>

I sent in the next wave of invasion. Peons! This is actually a good strat
besides the laughing value. When you got peons standing around, they
are expendable. And, Peons are great for killing Mages. So I
sorta ganked Termy's Mage. As seen below.<P>

I then sent in the sappers. Check out this baby.

<b>Bye Bye Mage & Tower.</b></a>(Warning 181k)<p>

I then sent in the sappers. Check out this baby.
<a href="PICS/s75c.gif">
<b>Sapper Run #2.</b></a>(Warning 131k)<p>

That left about 3 Knights. I sent in a Mage, 2 Paladans and an Archer.
I slowed his Knights and beat the heck out of them. Man I shoulda taken
a picture of that too :)<P>

Barney had quit a while earlier. I think after his mine blew, haha,
and after I took him off the sea for the 2nd time, he gave up.<p>

Cadaver then "blew up all the important buildings on red's island."<P>

It was shortly after Cad did this, Termy surrendered.<P>

<b>Stats.</b></a><p>

Man check those stats out. Termy had 45k more gold and look at my kills
compared to everyone else. I kicked some MO FO ass :)<P>

Pretty good camera work eh? :)<P>
