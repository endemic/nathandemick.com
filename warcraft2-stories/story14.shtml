I'm writing this because I get the feeling that some people take this game 
way too seriously.  I admit that I care about winning and losing, and I 
like getting points and stuff.  But I always try and remember that this 
is just a game.<p>

Here's something that really happened here in Ann Arbor.  I started over 
a Warcraft game.  By the end...it really wasn't about warcraft 
anymore...but at the beginning it was.<p>  

Anyways...I was playing war2 in the campus computing sites like I 
normally do.  Anyways...around here I have a reputation as being a good 
war2 player (kinda nice since on kali, I'm just okay).  So I walk in 
there, and these two guys come up to me and start saying, "Vermeer, 
Vermeer.  Play on our team."  I guess it was because they were getting 
beat that night and wanted some more firepower.<p>

Well...I end up playing with these 2 guys against 4 korean guys I've 
never seen before.  So...the first game goes by, and we win (these guys 
are really bad compared to you guys).  The thing is...they dragged it out 
really long.  It was so obvious that we had won, but all 4 dragged it 
out...running around building crap, until we finally eliminated them.  I 
was pretty mad becuae they had just wasted an hour of my life.<p>

But they wanted a rematch...and although it went against my better 
judgement.  I decided to play again.  We beat them again pretty bad too.  
Now it turns out...one of my teammates is both drunk and high.  So he 
goes over and starts talking some serious smack to them.  Not haha trash 
talk, but really swearing and stuff.<p>

Now what happens is...the 4 guys are pissed about losing, and I guess 
they can't take a little talk, even if it is a bit abrasive.  So they go 
outside and jump the guy who is high and drunk.  They bloody him up a bit 
and give him a black eye.  End of story right?  Not on your life.<p>

A few days later...I run into the guy who got beat up.  He's in the lab
looking for revenge.  But the other guys aren't there.  A few days later,
I run into one of the original 4 guys at another lab.  Then some guy
wearing all leather walks up to him and says, "you're one of the guys who
beat up my friend right?"  And starts flicking his hat.  The korean guy
(Dean) lies and says no.  The leather guy says, "You're a lying bitch." 
Then walks away.  About 10 minutes later, the leather guy returns, along
with 3 other guys, plus the guy who got beat up (Rico).  Rico goes up and
starts pushing the korean guy and starts swearing at him and stuff. 
Everyone tries to get him to step outside, but he doesn't (smart guy).  So
they just take his hat and leave.<p> 

It so happens that the Korean guy is at the lab with some friends.  So
they hop on the cell phone and dial furiously.  Meanwhile University
Security shows up and starts taking statements from the remaining 
people.  About 10 minutes after security leaves, about 10 of Dean's 
friends show up.  They offer to drive him home and stuff, and eventually, 
they clear out.  About an hour after than, Rico and his buddies return.  
They have gathered about 15 people as well.  From what I hear, the rest 
of the night, they both ended up looking for each other but didn't hook up.
<p>
The next night...they were supposed to meet and rumble.  But what 
happened was, Rico and his buddies showed up, but Dean and his buddies 
decided to bail and call the cops instead.  And that is how it stands 
as of 2 days ago.  I'm sure this thing isn't over yet.  I figure the only 
way this is gonna end is when someone gets sent to the hospital, or maybe 
worse.  These people are that stupid.<p>

Anyways...when I hear stories about how people are afraid to play other 
people over kali, or how shouting and swearing matches occur because some 
people don't want to challenge.  It makes me shake my head.  Who gives a 
fuck?  It's a video game.  All that is at stake is some silly number on 
someone's web page, and maybe a little pride.  Heck...from what I hear, 
Cpl Will is getting flooded by game results and associated things.  I'm 
not sure he is having much fun either.  And all he gets are complaints 
about his ranking system, his scoring system, his ladder system, etc.  
Why don't you thank him for the effort and time he is putting forth to 
give you guys a chance to beat your chest and say I'm good?<p>

So you aren't the best war2 player in the world?  So what?  Even if you
were, what is that gonna get you?  A fat, multi-million dollar contract? 
Flocks of beautiful women pounding on your door to kiss the hand that
operates the mouse?  It's a game guys, nothing more, nothing less.  About 
the only thing it will do is make your grades lower, make you exercise 
less, and make you less productive at work.  Blizzard made this game to 
make a buck off of people having fun, not by inciting gang wars or 
swearing contests over the internet.  Try and remember that next time 
you're pissed off because of this.<p>

Peace,<p>
