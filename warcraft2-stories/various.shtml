If it is of any help to you, I swear that in one of my laggiest games, I 
upgraded my townhall to stronghold and a tower to cannon at about the same time. 
By the tie they had both finished, I had two cannons and no hall at that locale! 
 Damn that put me behind :).  Good luck.  Seeya.

<a href="PICS/doh.jpg"><b>Doh!</b></a> Is this a funny pic or what?
Cnight discovers all his Hasted Lusted Dragons slowed by Shaf's Mages
hahahahhaha. It's snowing a little too on them :)

<a href="PICS/doh2.jpg"><b>Doh Again</b></a> If that wasn't bad enough,
I peon rushed him and killed his DK hahahahhaha. :)
<P>

<a href="PICS/doh3.jpg"><b>Doh 3?</b></a> Then I nailed his town with
sappers. <P>

<a href="PICS/invis.jpg"><b>Goofy trick</b></a> This is totally impractical,
but if you block paths with invis peons like here, and put some archers
or something, there is nothing the enemy can do sort of run away or
catapult or blizz the place. The units try to get to the archers but
they can't because the invis peons are blocking it. This only works with
peons we tried other units but they would attack. Once the invis wears
off you're screwed. Of course this will probably never happen in a real
game. This was a test game with Shaf.<P>

<a href="PICS/dong.jpg"><b>Long Range Dong</b></a> I nailed this DK
from long range, it was pretty funny.<P>

<a href="PICS/u.jpg"><b>U Formation</b></a> Check out this poor fellow
lose 4 farms or something. ~Creed~ took this shot I believe.<P>

<a href="PICS/wallin.jpg"><b>Beat those Campers</b></a> This is how I got
one of those Wallin dorks on Maze. What you do is put out a couple of
axers and bring them up to hit the peons trying to repair the farms. Makes
them runaway and you can brake in. ~Creed~ taught me that strategy.<P>

<a href="PICS/cat.jpg"><b>Cat Protection!</b></a> I was playing FOC
and ~Creed~ FOCing peon rushed me and started building towers on my mine.
He had a bunch of footmen too. He killed all my gold peons leaving me
with 5 wood peons. The only thing that kept him away was my Cannon
in the Nate formation. I chopped enough wood for a cat as his towers
were shooting down my hall. I got my catapult up. I wasn't able to really
hit anything so I popped out another one. I started getting Creed's towers.
Just then he ran in with a bunch of Knights. All I had was about 5 peons
and 2 Cats. Well Creed was thinking ha ha watch those cats die, but I ran
towards the farms above my hall and sealed in the cat with walls and
a farm. Haha look at his Knights Die. HAHAHHA. This allowed me
to stay alive a little longer till the Mages came :) I got the first
Mage but the 2nd got my whole town.<P>


<a href="PICS/chaos.jpg"><b>FOCing Chaos on Aqua!</b></a> Check out this
mess. We got Peons attacking, Juggs, what a mess!<P>

<a href="PICS/armada.jpg"><b>Shlonglor's Armada</b></a> From the same game,
here is my ships after I lost 1/2 of them to subs :) I only had one mine
too :)<P>

<a href="PICS/inviscat.jpg"><b>This guy</b></a>
is about to lose his mage to my Invisible Cat assassin.
Now that's something you don't see everyday :)<P>
<br clear=left>

Creed and I were playing vs 2 of his buddies. The Map was GOW. Creed started
at Purple and Aqua for me. We both headed up to left of middle at
the same time. But Creed got their first. So I go, oh crap, and decided
to go to Orange. But the enemy was there! So I said screw it and
<a href="PICS/bumrush1.jpg"><b>Built beside him</b></a>My farm is just starting
there in the way of his gold peons :)<P>

If you have never
tried that before, it's really fun. I built a farm and mill in the way
so he couldn't mine. It was high resources of course sooo. Just
<a href="PICS/bumrush2.jpg"><b>when it was getting fun</b></a> Creed quit
to chat because Crimson had dropped. What a shame. That was looking
to be some fun there :) I was Orange, Creed Yellow, and the enemy purple.
We had 4 guards on his 1 cannon there :)
<P>
<!-------------------TONs of guys----------------------------->
<a href="PICS/tons.jpg">
<b>Here</b></a>
is what happens when Shlonglor, Gotcha, Azure, and Marshall play
against you as allies.
<br clear=left><P>

<!-----------------CHRISM AND JONNY--------------------------------->
Chrism and Jonny played a huge game. It was a 1 on 1 that
lasted for 2 hours. What was so amazing was the stats. I've never seen
stats this high before. The game went back and forth the whole time but
Jonny finally won. It is really amazing though because Chrism had 100
more kills. 
<a href="PICS/war.jpg"><B> Take a
look at the stats.</b></a> You won't believe it.
<P>

<font color=00cc66>I played the crappiest War 2 player ever!</font> Heres what
happened: We started a 4 player game. I built my town. I had a town
hall, lumber mill, 2-3 farms, and maybe 7-9 peasants. This was about
5-10 minutes into the game. When, a peasant, who was not one of mine
walks into my village. The guy who was controlling that peasant types:
"Oh look a village, someone to beat up, ha ha ha". So he starts
attacking one of my peasants. So I set 2 peasants on his peasant and
killed him. Then I see the message that the guy, the guy who sent that
peasant, was eliminated from the game!!! About 10 minutes into the game
that guy still only had one peasant! And he sent him into my village to
attack me! And to top it off he was bragging about having someone's
village to beat up!!! Now thats a crappy player.<p>

Have you ever heard <a href="PICS/lagger.jpg"><b>this</b></a> before?<P>

Warp, LordHelmet, and Warp were playing vs Del Mar, Shadow, and Tangerine
on 3vs3 pud. Unforunately, Tangerine ran into a little
<a href="PICS/axer1.jpg">
<b>problem with my axers & LordHelmet's Ogres.</b></a> We all got together
for a 
<a href="PICS/axer2.jpg">
<b>group picture</b></a> after the game.<P>

Shaf and I were playing WWG and Ziggie 2on2 on Spiral. I was sitting
there destroying WWGs mine when he sends in a sapper. I was wondering what
he was going to do. Sapper the mine? Then he runs over and sappers my 
Juggs. Oh man, I nearly busted a gut laughing. 
<a href="PICS/sapp.jpg">
<b>As you can see,</b></a> my jugg took a lot of damage. hahaha.
For you idiots out there that are wondering what's so funny or amazing about
this: Sappers don't work on juggs :)<P>

I was on St Louis looking for someone when I see a game being
served as Shlonglo'. I decided to join as Gotcha. The guy is like
What's up Gotch. hahaha. Yeah like i'd say that haha. Didn't this fool
realize that if i was in fact gotcha, i would know about him being a fake?
Gotcha is only 4 feet away on the other side of an open door. haha. Did he
not know that? What a MORON :) 
<a href="PICS/fake1.jpg">
<b>Take a look</b></a><P>

<a href="PICS/long1.jpg">
<b> Where is this guys town hall?</b></a> It's not
<a href="PICS/long2.jpg">
<b>to the left of the mine.</b></a> It's certainly not below the mine or
to the right of it. Oh
<a href="PICS/long3.jpg">
<b>here it is.</b></a> Only 
<a href="PICS/long.jpg">
<b>this far</b></a> from the mine.<P>

I was sitting in Kchat and everyone goes, make up a milk name and join
the game. I couldn't think of a Milk name, So I join as Shlonglor. 
It was Spiral. I didn't have a clue who anyone was. The teams were to
be The milk guys and me and Gerg. I figured Greg was a smurf too. It
looked like Gred spelled backwards. I was red, and my teammate was 
aqua, the other 2 were on red and orange. The game was going along great
until I ask my teammate how many Juggs he had. He goes:" What are Juggs?"
Holy Crap! I said: "BattleShips?" He said: "What are they?" haha holy
crap. Was this guy joking? I had about 2-3 Juggs, I was doing this awesome
Wall in. Just then in comes both bad guys with a crapload of Grunts. Luckily,
I was walled in. I set all my peons on repair and started making Archers :)
I think, I can't remember exactly, but I think I got a tower up. However
it worked out, they backed off. Shaf started building a tower. But he dropped
hahahhahahahahhaha. I was working on a Cat and I think I most likely
could have fought it off. For some reason I chopped out later and forgot
about Silver's Grunts he had hidden on my Island. Luckily I beat them off.<P>

It was around then I found out that it was
Silverwolf and Shaf I was playing, and my teammate was some newbie. haha.
They stuck me with a newbie! Well with no Shaf, I ganked Silver's ass with
my Juggs. I got another island and it was pretty much glittering prizes
the whole game. I got tons of mages. I was over on Silver's Island when
my Dipshit Teammate started attacking me. WTF? It was like 30 minutes into
the game when he built his shipyard. He had towers all over the sea on
his shores. So Silver goes, how about you let me live and we will
beat him up. So I spare silver, and we took the punk out. I then stock piled
a ton of juggs. I had 10+ level 5s. and at the last momement I sent
them all in and ganked Silverwolf and killed him. haha. 81 kills to 20.
Screw you Silver! :)
<a href="PICS/silver.jpg">
<b>The Stats.</b></a> Shaf missed yet another attempt to smurf me. :)<P>

I was playing probably my 300+ smurf game on Spiral with I forget who.
We were destroying the guys 2nd mine as is standard practice, when the
guy starts repairing the mine. Man that was so funny..
<a href="PICS/spiral.jpg">
<b>Take a Look.</b></a><P>

<b><font color=00cc66>Trash Talkers get STOMPED!</b></font><br>
Me and my buddy *Mage* were sitting in kchat when some fools started talking
about how they could easily beat us. Well we couldn't let them sit there
and insult us knowing full well we could kick their ass. So we went 2on2
on low on POS. Suffice to say, the stat screen tells the whole story.
<a href="PICS/trash1.jpg">
<b>Newbies got their ass WHOOPED.</b></a> After the game they tried
to say, oh we didn't say you sucked. And they tried to say they didn't suck.
But for sure those were 2 of the crappiest War 2 players I have ever chanced
apon. They tried to say we double teammed them. But I took out one, then
went over to the other and helped mage stomp on him. Not that he needed
my help. Mage or anyone else could have easily taken them 1on2. So goes
the story. More trash talkers have to eat their words..<P>

I saw <a href="PICS/idiot2.jpg">
<b>this picture.</b></a> of a wallin by Isildur taken in a game
at the big kali fest. This is a wallin at Yellow (Bottom left) on
POS. Man is that the crappiest attempt at a wallin you ever seen
in your life? Last time I played Yellow, I sure didn't take 7
farms to wall myself in hahahahah. I had to set this as my wall paper
in windows :)<P>

I was playing Nowhere to run. The punk tried to peon rush me. So I decided
to teach him a lesson. I walked into his town. Built my barracks in
between his mine and hall. I put some walls on the left side, then
built a farm as you can see there, surrounding his mine completely. 
I then killed all his peons, teaching him, you don't peon rush the Shlong
on Nowhere to Run. :) <a href="PICS/nowhere2.jpg"><b>See the spectacle.</b></a><P>

Nowhere to run allows for some fun stuff. If you take a look at
<a href="PICS/nowhere.jpg">
<b>this picture.</b></a> you will see that I walled the guy's
mine off and then built a farm in the way. I trapped his peons
behind my farm and it was pretty funny. :)<P>

Warp and I were playing a game on POS. Take a look at 
<a href="PICS/pos.jpg">
<b>this picture.</b></a> I got a peon behind the tower. I planted
this tower right outside some newbies town. Every time he would try
to attack the tower, my guy stuck behind the tower would repair
the tower until the tower killed everyone. It was so awesome. 
The first tower worked out so cool, I decided to set up another one
the same way :) He couldn't get to the peons to stop them from repairing. He tried Capults but I reparied and I had some grunts around to kill it. That tower stayed
alive the whole game. It was so funny and it must have drove him crazy.
My little peon repair guys. haha. There only jobs were to keep my towers
repaired :)<P>

Warp and I were playing and we killed 2 people but one of them did the
hide one peon crap on POS. He had one peon left. We spent forever looking and finally found it. We chased him up to my town, red. We then decided to play
with him for pulling that stupid hide the peon trick on us. Warp and I both
clicked on allies for him. We then surrounded him with footmen and Ogres.
I built some walls around the peon and a tower too, to watch :) He couldn't moveand to get out he had to start hacking on my footmen. But everytime he
would kill one, I would sent another in. Warp even Bloodlusted his
peon for him for the added slap to the face :) It was so funny. 
<a href="PICS/fun.jpg">
<b>Take a look</b></a> at his little bloodlusted white peon. :)
<p>

I found the perfect way to Kill towers. haha.
