Just when I thought no game could be better than 
<a href="story60.shtml"><b>this game.</b></a> it happens. One of the
best games of all times....<P>

We had decided to try something new, play a pud. Gotcha was talking all
day about how he wanted a game on Whatkey. My record on whatkey was
like 0-4 the times I played on it :)<P>

We lined up the teams. It would be quite a game. Andrews boys & Silverwolf
vs Maddawg, Shaf, Wermacht, and StormShadow.<P>

The game got underway and the battle was fought for the center. We killed
the first guy we found 4on1. Then Gotcha pulls a dumb ass move and runs
around the trees the wrong way. So it was 3on3 in the fight for the middle.
Gotcha made it around and it was down to 1on1. Gotcha vs someone else.
Gotcha won with 1 hit point! hahaha. Our team scremed out in victory
and I said to the other team: "ok you may surrender now." haha.<P>

As it turns out, It was left vs right. That was quite a bit of luck
and made for a GREAT game. Warp was top right, Gotcha below that,
Silverwolf below Gotcha and me Bottom middle. Shaf was left of me,
Maddawg above him and Stormshadow above him. Wermacht was above and
right of StormShadow and left of Warp.<P>

Warp knew what his plan was, rush Werm. Warp went in, and discoverd that
mister Wermy thought it was a Sea level and had no idea you can walk through
the passages to each other. Werm was going down.<P>

Silverwolf and Gotcha were going sea. They were in big fights on the
sea. I didn't have a flyer or anything so I really didn't get to see
any of it.<P>

My worry was Shaf. He sent a little raiding party over, as I recall. 
<a href="PICS/s66a.jpg">
<b>My little set up.</b></a>
I had
a 2on1 set up. He sent over a raiding party with archers and footmen. BUT
I had a 2on1 set up with some axers and a catapult. On top of that Silver
had a ship there guarding the enterence haha. It was a slaughter. But
Shaf was up to castle and had mages. I was chopping away at the left side
and I saw that Shaf had rows of Knights lined up. It looks like he planed
on sappering in and rushing me. I was doing pretty crappy on my resources.
I only had level 3 or 4 Ogres. And I didn't have that many of them. Shaf
sent in a Sapper, I believe and got some of my Ogres, I forget..<p>

Maddawg and Storm had grabbed the middle, Gotcha had tried to invade but
got killed by Dks and Storm's lusted Ogres and Maddawg's million towers.

I got up a shipyard but I discoverd my oil spot was stolen. I played for another
10-20 minutes before realizing it was Silver that took my oil. Crap. I go
hey silver you dumb ass you stole my oil! He goes, oh, sorry you want me
to destroy the rig? I said nah. I then took the oil spot he was supposed
to take a BILLION miles away from my yard.<P>

It was looking bad for our heros.....<P>

Just then....... Stormshadow Drops. DOH! Like that doesn't ever happen eh? :)<p>

We sat around in war2 chat waiting, he finally came back and we restarted
on a save. This time the save was OLD. It was really old. I knew what Shaf
had and was planning so this time I handeled my town a bit better. I got up
to level 5 and quickly got Lust.<P>
 
This time, I loaded up my catapult in the transport I had, and 3 Ogres.
I went in on the middle with Gotcha. We had a limited success but
we lost our cats which put an end to the invasion. Maddawg had a ton of towers.
Storm came in and D&Ded us and hit us with lusted Ogres. We lost the 
middle again!<P>

During this time, Warp had destroyed Wermacht.<P>

In came Shaf with his Mage. He blizzard's my Ogres, he nails a bunch of them.
I layed some runes but I was too late. He got 3+ Ogres. Just then....<P>

Storm Drops. What a Suprise! That never happens!<P>

I was really hoping that the save was before the Shaf Mage ganked my Ogres
but no such luck. It was at that very moment. I killed Shaf's Mage but
he got a bunch of Ogres. Shaf went in a little while later and killed
one of my Dks. I got his Knights. He had a block of 4 knights sitting there
so I ran in with a sapper and got 2 of them.<P>

I ran into his town with Gotcha's Mage as backup. Gotcha didn't have his
flyer out and didn't notice Shaf still had knights. Shaf ran past my
Ogres straight for the Mage. The Mage was able to Blizzard Shaf's tower
but he didn't quite get it. I ran to save Gotcha's mage but it was too
late. We buried the old man by the sea :(<P>

I saw that one of the farms surrounding his walled in tower was almost
dead. Shaf was reparing the farms on the right that were on fire. I
lusted up and headed for that farm. I was able to take it, and get into
that burning tower and kill it. I then took all my Ogres and
started attacking his castle. But, mister mage man Blizzarded the
whole lot of them and due to bad control and good playing on his
part, he was able to kill all my Ogres with blizzard. DOH!<P>

I was down to 2 dks, and a bunch of peons. I had just enough money
left for another hall and something else. My mine was gone and all
my peons were chopping. That's when I said, hey, let's peon rush the
bastard :) I sent about 1/2 my peons into Shaf's town.<P> 

My peons were a bit pissed at those Mages for blizzarding my Ogres so
they
<a href="PICS/s66b.jpg">
<b>chased those bastard mages down.</b></a>

I began
attacking his Castle. I got it really badly burning when he ran in
with his peasants. 
<a href="PICS/s66c.jpg">
<b>We had a big peon battle.</b></a> With the experience
of a few peon only games, and with superior numbers, 
<a href="PICS/s66d.jpg">
<b> I was able to out fight his peon army.</b></a> After the
battle, I went back to
<a href="PICS/s66e.jpg">
<b>attacking his castle.</b></a>
Eventually, Just as a Mage was coming in,
<a href="PICS/s66f.jpg">
<b>I destroyed his castle.</b></a>

He suddenly had some mages. I rushed him with my peons and was able
to kill the mages. Muhahahahahha. 
I got the Mage tower on fire. He sent in one footmen. My 5 peons were
able to 
<a href="PICS/s66g.jpg">
<b>take the footmen.</b></a>

Buhahahahahha. I sent some more peons over, all I had left.
I think (pretty sure) I was able to take that Mage tower. Shaf then
came in with a Knight and killed my peons off. He was able to survive
with one knight. That's all he had too. Shaf and I have effectively
eliminated each other. hahahah. That's gotta be the first time I've seen that 
in a game. We both fought each other until we had nothing left :) I
was able to make 2 more Ogres and I didn't have any more gold for another
hall. Like I was going to get one anyway :) I also had 2 dks left, I had
hidden. I had one transport.<P>

Well there was certainlly no way in hell we were going to take the middle.
Maddawg had a 
<a href="PICS/s66i.jpg">
<b>billion towers on it.</b></a> On top of that, Storm was in the middle with
about 6+ Ogres with lust, and 4 or so Dks.<P>

Shaf, Maddawg, and Storm all started saying this was pointless. Let's
declare this a stalemate blah blah blah. Yeah right.<P>

Maddawg started pumping a 
<a href="PICS/s66h.jpg">
<b>lot of gryphons.</b></a> He had like 8 or so going around
attacking. Gotcha and Silver had the Mages and Archers. I don't know
what Warp had. I think he had some Dks tooo.<P>

Gotcha and Silver took Werm's old mine. It had 20k or so left in it
at the time. Maddawg sent in a bunch of Gryphons to the place and it
was massive anarchy. Like 5 people there. I sent up my 2 Dks and
attacked some of the gryphons. Maddawg chased after me. I got in my
transport and ran like the win. He started chasing the transport
but he gave up.<P>

We had to do something and we came up with a plan. Maddawg was really
the only one left alive. Storm had a bunch of crap in the middle but nothing
in his town. Shaf was out and Werm was eliminated. But Maddawg had
a TON of stuff. Mages, Gryphons, Knights, the whole lot.<P>

We decided to take shaf's Island first and work our way on land toward
Maddawg's place. I figured we had nothing and the game was over, but silver
was talking about his 10+ mages :)<P>

We landed on Shaf's place, well at least Warp did, but Gotcha and Silver landed at my place. I don't know why. Warp's like, I thought we were landing on Shaf.
I go to him, they changed their mind. Anyway, we made it to Shaf's place.
I told them, to make very very very sure, Maddawg doesn't snake a mage over
and blizzard all 10 of our mages and troops. That woulda sucked. 

We <a href="PICS/s66j.jpg">
<b>Started attacking Shaf's place.</b></a>

He then 
<a href="PICS/s66k.jpg">
<b> informed his teammates and us</b></a> what was going on. 6 Mages?
I only see 5 :)<P>

That is so funny. He had
mistakenly left on messages from the last time he was talking about
how playing on is "pointless" hahahahah.<P>

Oh man this next one. hahahha. 
<a href="PICS/s66l.jpg">
<b>Check this out.</b></a> Haha. He was saying to Maddawg, that he could
still lose this. That means that they were sure they had it won :)
<a href="PICS/s66m.jpg">
<b>Shaf then said his goodbyes.</b></a>
Then Shaf
<a href="PICS/s66n.jpg">
<b>got eliminated.</b></a> Buhahahahahha.<P>

We decided to do the same thing to Storm who was above Maddawg. Warp
and I went over and attacked Storm's town.<P>

<a href="PICS/s66o.jpg">
<b>Anyone see Blizzard City?</b></a> You can see 
<a href="PICS/s66p.jpg">
<b>the aftermath.</b></a><P>

At the same time, Gotcha and
Silver worked there way into Maddwag. They polymorphed mages, and did
the whole lot working their way in. They were able to bait Maddawg's
last 3 gryphons into a traop. Gotcha and Silver Polyed all 3 of them.
Y heard Gotcha laughing across the hall YEAH haha.<P>

I took that opportunity to sneak a Dk into the middle. I Decayed
a bunch of Storm's dks and Ogres. I don't think I killed any
of them. Shortly after, storm says something and leaves the game. He still had
about 4 Ogres and 3 or so Dks left in the middle too. Maddawg says
something like: "no I didn't mean that" hahaha. I guess he had informed
Storm that they were probably going down or something like that. So storm
left. He probalby could have held off the attack on the middle for  a while too. Gotcha, and Silver worked their way into Maddawg's town. Then pretty
soon the game was over. The middle could be easily decayed because
Maddawg didn't have any troops in the middle. With Storm's guys no
longer under control, I could just decay the towers at my leasure. 
<P>

Maddawg surrendered. We had won it. MAN. Stalemate? I couldn't wait
to go to kchat to tell both Storm and Shaf, screw you :)<P>

That had to be one of the coolest games I've ever played. That was
probably one of the greatest games in history. It was
fun for everyone but them :) Werm didn't get to see any of the game.
Poor guy :)<P>

<a href="PICS/s66q.jpg">
<b>The Stats.</b></a><p>
