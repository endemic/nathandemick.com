We were playing a big FFA on nowhere to Run 3, a pud made by Marshall (on my pud page).
I had accidently canceled construction on my first farm. I'm not sure if you know how
bad that is. After canceling construction, you need a few chops and a few mine
trips just to rebuild your first farm. Then you have to make like 2-3 trips to the mine
to build your first peon. Then you are behind on wood so you gotta chop extra long to
get that 2nd farm. Anyway, all this led me to the below position. The second I got up
my mill, I got up some towers and upgraded them. The towers began to fire on
Demon's peons and hall. That was great until he got a cat. I didn't even have a barracks
or smith. All I had was about 2-3 farms, a mill and a hall. haha. Well You would think
a cat would make quick work of my towers but check out this picture below.

Check it out, my two guard towers were hitting his hall and anyone mining they could
reach. BUT, Demon was hitting my left tower, But I had 2 peons repairing the tower! :)
So whenever the cat would hit the tower, the two peons would repair it. The towers
continued to hit the hall until the hall's strength was in the low red. Of course you
must be asking about resources? Yeah this was eating up all my wood. I had two peons
on wood and it was enough to keep me repairing that tower. haha. This was really
a no win situation for me. I was just staying alive. But my hope was I could take his hall.
As you can see, Demon has peons repairing the hall.<p>

Just before this picture, I said "I HATE YOU DEMON!". That is his reply :)<p>

<b>Note:</b> You can also see Khisanth begging for his life :)<br>
Please let me have enough wood for a flying machine so I can watch :)

when this happened. Demon brought in 3 Cats. That was the Death of Shlong.

Demon ran in with a load of footman and just when he was about to finish me off,
he dropped. What was funny was Demon's footman almost killed me when he was
gone. I barely fought them off. Anyway, the cool thing was the tower, cat thing :)

Not really a story but it was pretty funny.<p>
