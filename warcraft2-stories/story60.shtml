I will try to put this down as close as I can remember it. If any of you
in the game want to add or correct what I throw down here, please do.<P>

Gotcha and Warp were sick of Diablo, we tried playing Doom2, but Warp's
computer was lagging us down, so we decided on some War 2. Gotcha
finally got his own registration number for Christmas (90k I think)
which allows Warp, Gotcha, and I to all play on Kali at the same time
for the first time only recently. We decided on an Andrews vs All game
on FOC. We knew we were unstoppable. We won a few games on FOC before,
(Vermeer, Silverwolf, & Kurdan went down vs the Andrews boys a few weeks
before) Sooooo, we got on Kchat, Starlink and talked up some trash.
<P>

&lt;Shlonglor&gt; The Andrews boys are looking for three players to "attempt"
to beat us at War 2.<P>

hahhahahahhaa. Well LrdSchroeder, Khisanth, {{NaTe}}, and Isildur,
took up the challenge. Lrd, made it in before Isildur, so I used that
as an excuse to boot Isildur's ass, hahahhaha. We finally got everyone in
that chatroom, and It was to be Andrews boys (Warp, Gotcha & I) vs
Khisanth, {{NaTe}} and LrdSchroeder, on FOC on Low.<P>

We got the game started. I was at Orange, Gotcha got Purple
(DOH!!!!!!!!), and Warp got Red. Khisanth got Yellow, NaTe White, and
Lrd got black.<P>

The game got underway, and the connection was pretty darn nice. We
were trying to come up with some strategy. We thought mass invasion, but
we gave up that idea. I said go ALL JUGGS. Like Always. We all agreed,
(Warp, Gotcha & I) that we had to get transports and get the 2 free
extra islands EARLY. As it turns out, those islands were Aqua, and
Blue.<P>

I left my messages on to all, because Warp, Gotcha and I were in the
same room pretty much. I started talking it up. "Who will win?"
"Two islands who will get them who will lose them?" "Who wins, who
loses" "Who goes all land, who goes all juggs?" haha. They said:
"We will win" hahahahahah.<P>

We decided to make the game interesting by not taking the normal oil
spots for our particular locations. That gave Warp the Possibility of
not getting spotted since he was Red. Gotcha was bound to be found
seeing as how he was purple. They found me pretty early. I put my
shipyard on bottom of Orange.<p>

Well we decided to triple team Black, which turned out to be
LrdSchroeder. We kept sending in ships. NaTe and Khisanth kept sending
in Juggs too. It was some pretty fierce ocean combat, hahahah. We all
had 2 shipyards pumping those babies.<P>

I started
running into lumber and farm trouble. I had to get like 3 peons
repairing a farm. I got up a walled in Guard tower using the NaTe
formation, and one Guard tower outside the NaTe formation. As it turns
out, I then got invaded by the inventor of the NaTe formation, NaTe!
He sent in a few Grunts. I had a few of my own. I think 2. He started
wasting my lumber peons. I was able to beat the invasion off after a
while. But that pretty much put me way the hell behind.<P>

I got about 3 juggs. I had 2 building. I decided instead of going to
Lrd, where Gotcha and Warp were fighting, to attack white where NaTe
was. I got to his shipyard and found a transport. I tried to get it but
my Juggs were too damn slow. (I was playing humans). I decided to work
on his oil rig. Just then I see like 6 Juggs, (black Khisanth
Battleships) shooting at my yard. Holy CRAP! They came in, and I knew
they were coming to save NaTe. So I pulled the smart move. I ran the
hell away. I ran all the way up to top right where Warp was. I took the
long way around too. Khisanth went to NaTe with his Juggs, but I
wasn't there anymore buhahaha. During that time I had one I built one
transport. Lrd's 2 Juggs where there and I ran for it. The 2 Lrd Juggs
immediately followed it. I knew he had a lock. I built another
transport, and I was able to sneak another Jugg around the corner above
Khisanth's Fleet at NaTe's at White. I ran with it to upper right,
Warp's, where we were massing our fleet. I now had 4 Juggs at Warp's
place. I told Warp and Gotcha to mass
everything they could top right, because there were at least 9+ enemy
juggs. A Shipload! :)<P>

Sometime around or before than, NaTe invaded again. He took that
transport, that I couldn't get, I think. He invaded with 2 Grunts. He
really screwed me up bad too, because he had like level 3 Grunts, my
Footmen were still level 1. I was able to beat off the invasion. While
Khisanth's Juggs were going to save NaTe, (where I wasn't there cuz I
ran :) Khisanth and Lrd, came back and finished off my Shipyards.<P>

We massed our fleet, 2 Gotcha Battleships, 4 of my Battleships and at
least 2 of Warps. Gotcha informed us that most of them were dead..
Their fleet was attacking Gotcha's yards on Purple. It was made up
of 9 Khisanth Battleships. We went in
to face the enemy fleet. The guns were blazing. Men on the ship fighting
hand to hand combat. Ships rammed each other. Some ships were on fire.
Our alliance forces fought bravely but 
after it was all over, they still had AT LEAST 4 Battleships. DOH.
That was our last attempt to win the sea. They now had total control of
the seas.<P>

During this time, I snuck my Transport around the top of my island and I
grabbed about 6 peasants and put them in. Warp informed me that some
peasants (Lrd's I think) tried to set up camp on his island, thinking it
was free, haha. Gotcha had already set up a bunch of towers on Aqua and
Blue, the 2 free islands. I decided to run up to blue. It was around
then my mine blew, and I stuck all my peasants on my home island on
lumber, I was SCREWED for lumber.<P>

As I landed on Blue, there was a Purple Transport, (Gotcha's) right
where I landed. I then saw a white transport land. I started laughing,
because I knew that island was ours. I couldn't wait until white (Lrd)
found out. haha. I was thinking hahahah what a dumb ass. As it turns
out, I was the dumb ass as you will later see what he did with those
peons. haha.  Well I moved all my peasants by the mine. Gotcha had
3 guard towers there. I couldn't think what I wanted to do. I didn't
have enough wood for a hall. So I had the peasants stand there. I SHOULD
have walled in Gotcha's towers during that time. That could have helped
the game a whole lot. But I didn't.<P>

I had made about 5 Grunts at home. A while later, I moved my peasants on
Blue and I found that Lrd had built two guard towers, a barracks, and he
had like 2 footman on the island by the towers SHIT. If I only had
watched I could have stopped it. People always try that tower their way
into your island shit. haha. Well I was in big time trouble. He could
tower his way into Gotcha's towers. I got all the peasants building my
barracks on Blue. I had built about 5-6 level 2 or so Footman at home.
I snuck my transport in a round about way to my island. I loaded up
my footman, I had 1 footman at blue, and a Catapult training to take
Lrd's towers. As I got up to Blue to invade, Lrd sent in a Catapult and
got my tower that was upgrading. SHIT! He had a cat first. Mine was
about to pop out. My cat popped out and I sent it after his. I think It
miss fired or something. All his footman charged it. I ran with the cat
back to Gotcha's 3 Guards. My one footman was beating on Lrd's back
the whole time. I landed my transport and sent in my other footman. He
ran back to his towers. He still had that cat. DOH! I sent my cat after
his tower, and It fired one shot or something but the stupid ass cat,
charged the tower and got killed by it. He then had a cat. I had one
option. I charged with all my footman. They got stuck and ended up
walking around a bunch of trees all while the towers hit them.
Fuck!!!!!!!!!!! What a bone head move. I either made some more footman or
got another transload up there, I forget which, I think I just made a
few. Just then, in comes a bunch of Bloodlusted Ogres. NaTe's Ogres.
Shit! I was still at town hall with level 2 or 3 footman. haha. We
had lost the island. Crap!!! Gotcha's towers, and my footmen were able
to kill and damage some of NaTe's Ogres before I went down. NaTe lusted
all Lrd's footmen. What an ass whooping!<P>

As it turns out, Gotcha had also lost Aqua. It was all over. They
owned the sea, they owned the two free islands. We were finished. I was
running out of money. How did we lose the game we were all thinking.
What did we do wrong? I thought we had played great. They had a bunch of
towers on White and now had Aqua, and NaTe had lust, on top of the
freakin' billion Juggs they had. They took out my foundry and all I had
left was like 2 tankers, and 1 transport with 1/2 health. It was all
over.<P>

Warp, sometime before, I believe had invaded Lrd. Lrd didn't have
anything, but he did have a few Guards. Warp had the smith down to below
100 hit points, but he didn't watch the thing. Lrd was repairing it and
not only that, he was building a tower. Warp wasn't paying attention and
next thing he saw, the guard was beating up his guys and he couldn't do
a thing. He really boned that one. haha.<P>

Warp said he had a few Ogres and a Death Knight with Decay. He was
sitting right next to me and we aligned our transports (I had 3 level 3
Footman) We decided to see if we could take Aqua. We landed and ran in.
Red (NaTe) had NOTHING. We killed the peons and started beating on the
hall. All our forces were split up. Then in comes 6 Lrd footman, Who
knows what level. We could have easily taken him but our forces were
split up. Doh. It was like 6 on my 2-3 footman. My Footmen went down.
Warp got over there and he took out the footman. Phew! Invasion beat
off. I got my transport with like 45 hit points, and ran into my island,
snagged my 6 or so last peasants and ran to Aqua. I set up a hall. Just
then in comes bloodlusted Ogres. The same ones that got me at white.
Shit!!!!! I canceled my hall knowing it was a gonner (It was probably a
bad idea, now that I think back) Warp started decaying the Ogres and
sent all his guys against them. Man as it turns out, it came down to
2 Peons of Warp's beating on one of NaTe's Bloodlusted Ogres haha.
Guess what? Warp won! Buhahhahahahahahhahahahah!<P>

During that time I spent money on one catapult. I figured I could pull
some hit and run action on Lrd, on blue. But..... The bloody second
I unloaded my cat, his cat happened to be right by it. His cat fired the
second I unloaded. He got a full hit. Crap. I moved my cat around, and 2
times it misfired. I clicked on his catapult, and Lrd sent his back to
his towers. My catapult decided to follow it, and I wasn't watching. I
looked up and my catapult went right by one of Lrd's footman. I figured
the footman was after the catapult and it was all over. BUT, he ran
right by it. hahaha. He ran to my transport with his footman and started
beating on it. hahaha. I ran with the transport. I can't remember exactly
what happened there after. He got my cat, and I think I either got his
cat, or it survived and died at a later time. I'm not sure how or who
finally killed that bastard Catapult :)<P>

We still had the island. Gotcha had sent a few peasants over. We knew
Lrd was mining Blue full steam and that we were for sure going down. We
had no chance. I mean Lrd had towers and all that crap up at blue.
<P>

Gotcha then came up with a plan. He was across the hall, (our rooms are
connected by a hall) yelling: ok guys, spend whatever you got, no matter
what the cost, get some cannons or guards up at Aqua." If you remember,
I had canceled my hall. That left me with like 1192 gold. I was like 8
gold short of a hall. SHIT! It was decision time. If I built the tower,
I was out of the game. If I didn't build the tower, I would still have
to ferry 8 gold from that island back to my hall, just to build a hall.
I decided to sacrifice my life and commit suicide to build the tower. I
built the tower and started upgrading it. I was in the process of
walling it in when the most hilarious thing happened.....<P>

An Invasion of Red peons. I had 4-5 peons. 2 were busy making walls and
stuff. Warp had 1-2 peons. Gotcha had a few.. It was peons only. And we
faced a peon invasion hahahaha. What resulted was a 4 person peon
battle. It was so funny. NaTe started kicking our ass tho'. 
Gotcha was yelling: "Is that tower coming on line any time soon?" I
yelled back: "Yeah, almost up" the bar was right almost at the top.
We were going down until my tower came on line. My Guard killed those bastardly
peons and won, probably the only 4 person peon battle/invasion I've
ever seen or heard about in a real game. hahaha.<P>

<img src="PICS/s60a.jpg" with=402 height=448>Here is a picture of the battle haha.<br
clear=left><P>

I had 2 peons left and about 115 Gold, 1 transport, and that's about it.
I had like 4000 lumber. During this time, Warp, because he doesn't know
the maps, had built his hall sorta near the sea on red. The enemy had
taken his hall on the sea. He was out of the game because he didn't have
enough gold for a hall and no where to send the peons back with the
money.<P>

During this time, Gotcha had built a few sappers. He had got a few of
Lrd's towers on Blue. He got the barracks Lrd built too. Lrd was mining
away. Gotcha snuck a few Knights in and started slaughtering the peons.
Since Warp was out of the game, he decided to peon invade the same
island. Lrd had one tower left, I think. Warp went for it and I think he
got it almost dead. I saw Lrd land a few more peasants on the island.
After Warp's peon invasion, he left the game. There was some guy in our
room the whole time distracting us. He was a total computer newbie. He
didn't have a clue what was going on. He was asking stupid ass questions
like: "Do you know these people you are playing?" "Are you playing
over the internet?" The whole time he was trying to talk to Warp about
some damn stupid class. I was trying to yell over his babbling to Gotcha
across the hall. After Warp left, I was dead too. I spent it all on that
tower on Aqua. I left my computer and went into Gotcha's room to watch.
I had figured it was all over.<P>

Gotcha had 1 transport with like 0 hit points. If they would have been
smart, they would have had all those Juggs on patrol or at least had 1
transport, but they didn't. Gotcha built a hall on Aqua by my tower. He
starting making sappers and Knights as I said above.<P>

During that time, Gotcha's 3 Knights had Lrd's hall almost dead on Blue.
It was around then I see some black peasants (Khisanth's), they ran in. 
Gotcha killed some of them I believe. I'm not exactly sure, they might have 
been white peasants (Lrd's). Lrd started trying to repair the hall. Gotcha
ran around and tried to kill the peasants but they ran back to Lrd's
tower. Gotcha sent the Knights back to the hall and put them on stand
ground. I'm not exactly sure if Gotcha got that hall or not. I think he
did but I'm not sure. What I do know is they were massing a peon army
with at least one red Ogre. They bloodlusted the peons and the one ogre
ran in. Gotcha's 3 Knights (level 1) took on all those peons and the
Ogre and lost! hahhaha. They had won the island. I know I'm screwing
this story up. haha. The order is probably boned.. Anyway....<P>

<font color=00cc66><b>The peons and Ogre win the battle.</b></font>
<br clear=left><P>

Gotcha was still training Knights, his place was slowing going on Aqua.
He got a Sapper and Knight and he went in. He got 2 of Lrd's towers with
one hit. I'm not sure if it was at this time or earlier but I know for
sure tha the got 2 towers with his sapper. At this time Lrd had either
built another hall, or repaired the first one. I'm not exactly sure.
Gotcha kept training knights. The first Knight got killed by some peons.
They peon attacked his Knight and beat it. HAHA. Lrd had a tower, or
someone else had a tower upgrading. Gotcha sent in another Knight. I
told him to wait until he could group them but lucky he didn't. He
started beating on the Tower with one knight. He had that tower good and
burning when it came on line. Crap! We were both chanting: "go go go go."
The Knights hit points were going down down down, but he beat the tower.
hahaha he killed it. Gotcha had another sapper. He ran in with it, just
then I see a black sapper (Khisanth's) Khisanth blew up Gotcha's Knight
1on1, and Gotcha's sapper blew up right around there and got nothing. I
think he mis-clicked or something. I ran into my room and started
sending my 1 peasant back and forth trying to ferry enough gold to build
another hall. I heard Gotcha in the other room say Khisanth hit Lrd's
hall with with his sapper. Khisanth killed one of Gotcha's Knights with
it, but Gotcha didn't really care about the Knight. He was too busy
laughing at how Khisanth hit Lrd's hall. hahahhahahahhaha. 
Oh man that was funny.<P>

Gotcha was able to finally take out Lrd's stuff on Blue. It was around
then they said something like: "ok good game." Holy crap! We had won!
I was out, Warp was out, yet we still won the game! Man they had both
islands, the sea, and lust. We had jack sheet! But that was it. Gotcha
had Aqua and Blue. He set up towers on both. NaTe decided that was
enough, he left the game after saying bye. Lrd and Khisanth still had a
ton of Juggs. I was able to ferry 400 gold to my hall. I got enough for
2 peons. I loaded them both in my transport. Just then Khisanth sunk it.
Doh! I got lazy and took the direct route right by Khisanth's Tanker and
he got my only transport. That was it. I was out. Khisanth was laughing
it up. I was yelling damn you! ;)<P>

Gotcha continued on. It was him vs Khisanth and Lrd now. They sent all their
Juggs around the islands trying to pick off anything they could. Gotcha
got up to Castle and decided to gank em with Gryphons. Khisanth was
saying he was ready to quit. Gotcha said: "wait" He got out his Gryphon
and started attacking Khisanth and Lrd's Juggs. He said, "ok that's cool
can I leave now?" Gotcha said: "yes" Khisanth left. Lrd continued on.
I took a screen shot and left the game. Lrd eventually quit. I didn't
watch. I was too busy in Kchat talking it up telling the story. haha.<P>

That had to be one of the coolest games ever. Never have I seen Peons
so directly determine the outcome of a game. NaTe said he had 2 DKs
which could have saved the game. I don't know what happened to them, or
why he didn't use them. But we had come from dead to winning the game.
It was a large part due to me sacrificing it all to put up that tower.
That allowed Gotcha to keep aqua and build enough stuff to take out Lrd
and company on blue. Lrd had spent all his stuff on towers and such and
that is part of the reason why he lost the Island. Khisanth had gone
100% sea. I don't think he ever even made any ground troops at all. But
that also had cost them the game. Just a few footman of Khisanth's and
they would have won. NaTe had invested all he had on those Bloodlusted
Ogres and DKs, I guess. Once those bloodlusted Ogres were dead, that was
it. If he had invested in a bunch of footman instead or just plain
Ogres, he could have also won the game. There were a lot of Ifs in that
game and mistakes on both sides, but what is so amazing is it came down
to peons battles deciding the games. hahaha. What a totally awesome game.
An Epic drama.<P>

Take a look at the stats. That's the first game Warp and I lost but
we won :)<P>
