Gotcha and I won our first IWL team game. It was awesome. This was the
most fun game I've ever played. Here is what happened. The map was high
seas. Gotcha and I had the worst positions. I was Orange and Gotcha was
red, the worst. Both of us could be hit by the sea. So we knew we had to
dominate the sea. Jff was white and Sliver was Yellow. Perfect
positions. Jff, Sliver and I were Orcs and Gotcha was Human of course.<p>
I started building. I built my first Jugg. Then I sent
it down to Gotcha's town to help him out. I guess Jff was attacking him
with a Jugg. It turns out Gotcha did not need my help. He took out the
Jugg 1 on 1. We then, decided to send our ships up to yellow. We passed
Sliver's Jugg and we quickly killed it. I had a second Jugg out and I
sent it. I attacked Sliver's oil rig while Gotcha focused on Sliver's
foundry. After I got rid of the oil rig, I went to help out Gotcha. I
built another Jugg. I sent it down to help. We took out any Juggs that
popped out, Sliver's foundry
and Jff and Sliver's shipyards. Then, because Sliver did not plan,
attacked and destroyed a bunch of Sliver's farms. He had them lined up
in a nice line that could all be hit by ships. Sliver whipped out a
catapult and sunk one of my Juggs cuz I was not watching. I went in with
my Jugg and killed the catapult.<p> 

I was up to Stronghold, was upgrading
my guys to level 3. But I had no land defenses, unless you call peons a
defense, haha. So Jff invaded me, early too, with 6 level 3 or so
Grunts. He took out all my peons but one. Every time I would make an
Ogre, Jff would kill it. So I stopped making guys, what I did not
realize is that I had 5000 gold. But I had no lumber. So since I had no
lumber, I just assumed I could not make any guys at all. I forgot grunts
require no lumber.  I could have kept making Grunts. 
So, I called to Gotcha for help. Gotcha sent in
a transport with some knights and saved me. It was a perfect save. We
took out his invasion.<p>

I had pulled the foundry trick that game. The
trick is when you build a foundry in the river, your peon pops out on
the other island. No transport. I was orange and I built my foundry and
popped out on Black's Island.
So I got my guys rolling in my main town
and I built a town hall in Black's spot where my guy had popped over. I
also built some farms and a lumber mill on that side.<p>

Around this time, Gotcha could not bring his ships in close to Jff or
Sliver because they had the Death and Decay. But, Gotcha was able to 
keep Sliver out of the oil. He just kept his ships by yellow's oil, out
of the way of the Death and Decay. He kept destroying Sliver's oil rig,
every time he would build it again. He destroyed it like 4 times. I
destroyed it once too remember, poor sliver. haha. Look at the picture
at the end and see how much oil he had. None haha.<p>

I guess it was sometime around then that Gotcha got invaded by Sliver I
think. Gotcha was able to fend off the attack.
Then Gotcha invaded Sliver. He took out all of Sliver's guys and most if not
all of his peons. That screwed Sliver big time. But Jff had sappered
through to Slivers island and he sent in a ton of bloodlusted ogres and
killed all of Gotcha's guys.<P>

But I knew nothing about
all this because I was still at Stronghold and was far behind cuz Jff
invaded me. I had no flying machines.
Just then Jff invaded my new town with Bloodlusted Ogres.
He destroyed everything. By that time I was able to go up to fortress
and whip out the bloodlust. He destroyed my town hall, tons of peons and
barracks. But I sent over a transport full of Ogres and I took him out.
Not before he destroyed everything though. So, I rebuilt my hall for the
second time. By that time, Jff had some dragons. I built my town hall in
blacks spot again. I made one guard tower and an axeman. I also made a
barracks. Then I discovered that Jff had built his foundry in the stream
between white and black. But I was now in blacks spot, haha. So I made a
catapult and took out his foundry and 4 farms. I was expecting someone
to death and decay the catapult but no one came. haha. He also had a
shipyard there and I got it with some Juggs.<p>

Then Jff sent in a
dragon to my new town, I think either I killed it, or it ran. Just then 
Jff sent in
6 Bloodlusted Ogres again. Like an idiot, I had no defenses at that town
again. Everything got destroyed. So I sent in a transport again and got
rid of his guys. I rebuilt my town hall there again for the third time!!!!<p>

Doing my terrible re-con job again, I did not know that the whole right
side of the high seas map had towns in it. Enemy towns!
I need to re-con more. I found
Jff had a new town. And it was not protected. So I sent in a boatload of
Ogres. I killed most of his peons and started working on his farms. I
was bloodlusted of course. But Jff sent in a dragon. I had no defenses
against it. So I said, fine give me all the dragon you want I'm still
going to attack. So I was able to destroy 2-3 farms before he killed all
my ogres. Well worth it. So I sent in another boatload. This time I sent
Ogres, a sapper, and 2 axeman. I unloaded in a 1 guy wide passage way. 
By that time
he had reinforced his town with bloodlusted Ogres. I fought in a narrow
passage way. Then I said screw this and put them all back in the
transport. I went around to a nice place to land. I landed my guys and
sent in a sapper which killed 3 of his ogres. I then moved in. He sent
the dragon in again and I was down to just Ogres. I was able to take out
all of Jff's farms but one, and that farm was on fire big time. I sent
in my next load of guys. He sent in the dragon but this time, I had 4
bloodlusted Berzerkers! That dragon got wasted. Just then I see a bunch
of Red peasants. I'm thinking who is this. The I said to Gotcha "what is
going on here?" He goes, 
"you said this island was free". So I go "no there
is a battle still going on here". He did not care. He started building
his town hall there even before Jff's hall was destroyed! Gotcha is so
cool. Then I found out that Jff had a town below the town we just
destroyed. So Gotcha and I went in and got rid of it.<p>

Then we started
talking about Normandy. The big invasion of Jff and Sliver coastline. We
planned for months. Well not really just a few seconds. I sent in 3
transports. Gotcha sent in 1 or 2. We sent them all in at once. I expected
to find a huge resistance but there was nothing. We took out all Sliver's
buildings one by one. Then when we had him pretty much gone. I massed my
Ogres and Berzerkers for the big one. The invasion of Jff. I had maybe
20+ Ogres all ready. I thing did a fly-by of Jff's town expecting to see
a million Ogres but there was nothing. So I go screw this and walked
through the sapper hole in the rocks to whites, Jff's town. I thrashed on
it big time, with tons of bloodlusted Ogres. No opposition whatsoever
in Sliver's or Jff's town. I'm thinking we got these punks when I see 
my town being Death and Decayed. I ran my flying machine all around but
did not find anything. So I gave up looking. <p>

Just then, I guess Jff
invaded or re-took his 2nd town, the one Gotcha moved into. The
bloodlusted Ogres destroyed Gotcha's hall and all his peons. We all know what
happens when bloodlusted Ogres attack Knights. The Knights DIE! But that
did not bother Gotcha. He set up a town in Blues spot. Just then I get
Death and Decayed in my town again. I'm thinking "OK bitch, I'm going to
get that Death Knight now. I fly all around and then I discover that
both Sliver and Jff were mining from Purple's mine. There was like 50
white and yellow peons mining from the same mine. It was such a
beautiful sight. No defenses. All ripe for invasion.<p>

Sometime around then
Jff invaded my main town. He destroyed my Fortress with a bunch of
bloodlusted Ogres. The thing had been on fire the whole game from Jff's
first attack. That is 1 fortress and 2 town halls I lost!!!! Jff is so
mean, haha. So I brought in some guys from our invasion forces to kill
the guys in my town. Then Invaded Sliver and Jff's final town. I killed
like a million peons. It was awesome. They were down to attacking us
with Grunts. Gotcha did not want to miss out so he invaded too. Then
they gave up. hahahah. My Stormreaver and Gotcha's Azeroth. 
The clans unite to Kick
some serious ass. Twilight Hammer, Jff and Sliver's clan was dealt a defeat
at the hands of the Orc/Human Alliance!!<p>

Check out the victory screen.<p>

Notice Sliver's oil. None, haha. Gotcha made sure of that. Notice Jff's
kills. He killed all my peons 3 times and gotcha's once. I'd say a large
amount of those kills are from killing peons. Also see my gold? Even
after having 2 town halls destroyed and one fortress, I out-mined
everyone. I never mined all my mines either. They were both still
there.<p>
