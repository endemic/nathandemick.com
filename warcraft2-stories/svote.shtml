I have made the program so it only accepts one vote per section of ISP.
I did this because if I didn't, there would always be some jerk who
would keep voting over and over again. There are all kinds of other better
ways to solve this problem such as using cookies and all that jazz but this is my favorite way. This means you should try your best to be the first one
on your ISP to sign up. Now I'm not saying one person PER isp because
some of the bigger ISPs have larger number of people, but this program takes
that into account.<P>

In your voting, vote how you feel, don't vote based on how everyone
else picked. Let's not make a follow the leader in this voting process.<P>
