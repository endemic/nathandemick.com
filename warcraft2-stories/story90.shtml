<p>Krib and I decided to play some NWL (yes, i actually joined a league, well, i was bored :) But after not having much luck we decided to setup a game in kchat. Krib couldn't get anyone to play so sent this message:</p>

<p><font color="red">*Nostradomus and Krib are looking for a 2on2 nwl game...who wants some?</font></p>

<p>Hahahah :) Well *KingAngel* and *ArchAngel*(aka. SKYANGEL) were up to the challenge. SO i served up a game of FOC because, as a lot of people know, I LOVE water and Krib does too. But alas, SKYANGEL adamantly refused to play league games on water, arguing with "Well, i sorta play fgow" and "C'mon guys I give people like a thousand points." You see, SKYANGEL was like top third of his burning blades clan and according to the NWL's experience system, you get 230 pts. for beating him 1on1. </p>

<p>Anyway, after wrangling for 5 or so minutes over the map, SKYANGEL said: <font color=red><b>"I'll play any land map."</font></b> So we picked Maze (my favorite land level because i like to play humans). </p>

<p>So we start, maze/low. I got blue, Krib was aqua, Sky got black, and KingAngel got orange. Everyone had pretty good starting locations. However, things didn't start out too well for me.</p>

<p>I was making TONS of mistakes. I had 3 peons on gold and 2 on lumber!! :( I eventually pulled that peon off of gold, but that sure screwed me over big time. When Krib was done with his 2nd farm, i was just starting mine!!! DOH!!! I knew i was hours behind everyone else.</p>

<p>Our plan was that Krib would wall-in with towers and head for lust. My plan was just to get TONS (20+) footmen while getting the necesseties for knights and then go for mages. So i just built whatever i felt like :)</p>

<p>My footmen are starting to churn out and I do some scouting. King was walled in at his back door and I assume the same for his main entrance. I went to orange (SKYANGEL) at black's spot. He didn't have too much. I wacked a few of his wood peons with my 1 footman before going down vs. 2 of his grunts. </p>

<p>I send 9 more level 4 footmen to attack Sky while getting the final shields upgrade and going to keep. Unfortunately for him, my footmen stumble upon his expansion at left side middle. He was in the middle of its consolidation. But alas for him my footmen ran in and killed ALL of his gold peons. I got into some fights with a few of his level 3 grunts and ogres. But no matter, I was pumping out the knights now :) I had his mound in the yellow zone before he fought me off.</p>

<p>All this time, I hadn't a clue what Krib was doing. I believe the enemy were throwing tons of grunts at his wall-in. But the wall-in stayed intact and he ended up killing a total of 31 grunts (he counted :)</p>

<p>Anyway, I had a second mine going full force to my right, 2 inventors pumping out demo squads, ready to take out any and all enemy fortresses, smiths, ogre mounds, and barracks; and I had 4 barracks madly pumping out knights. My castle had just finished constructing and I think a while before, KingAngel came down with 1 grunt haha. Anyway, I gathered up a bunch of knights and footmen to hit Sky's expansion. I guess Krib had the same idea, I asked him to join me. "I'm there" came his response, and I see a bunch of purple ogres arrive at about the same time as my knights.</p>

<p>So I decided to let Krib take care of the expansion. He had already wiped out Sky's whole town off the map. I had lots of mages with slow and blizzard, around 12 demo squads and tons of knights from 6 active barracks. Krib had d/k's and lust, I think we both had 3rd mines (i know i did); so basically we won the game.</p>

<p>I decided to blizzard king's gold peons at his expansion. Krib had the same idea and we ended up d&d/blizzarding at the same time hahahaha :) What a great partner. We then leveled KingAngel's whole town. It wasn't much of a game but the following was what really bothered me.</p>

<p>It was at this point SKYANGEL began to whine. He said:<font color=red><b> "I wanna rematch on my speed [top speed]" "I can't play default speed."</font></b> Basically saying the only reason we won was because the speed was one notch below top. Well, we all know that it's a load of crap. A lower speed doesn't have any negative effect on the game; everyone has better  control. Krib and I denied their rematch and said speed hikers really suck. "These guys are too SCARED to play top speed." replied skyangel. We started laughing. Hahaha, oh man what a comeback eh? :)</p>

<p>The plot thickens...then SKYANGEL said something that shocked all of us: <font color=red><b>"Ok, RTC"</b></font> Oh man, we were laughing so hard! Everyone on kali with any sort of clue knows that it's a mortal sin to return to chat in a war2 game. So we told him we wanted to see the stats. He's like: <font color=red><b>"Why?"</b></font> hahahah. I think were still pretty nice to him, with a hint of sarcasm in our words :)</p>

<p>Well, no matter what he tried, calling us newbies, etc. I was the host and I wouldn't rtc. I then eliminated him so we didn't have to listen to his complaining.</p>

<p>You don't have to put this story up if you don't want to, but I just wanted to say this was a very startling situation, and from an experienced war2 player?? This is simply appalling! </p>

<p>I don't like ragging on people, but this just had to be said. I think more people should read your war2 etiquette page :) The BB guys were pretty nice, but SkyAngel's behavior really disappointed me in the end. </p>
