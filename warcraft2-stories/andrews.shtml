<center><font size=+2 color=00cc66>Who were the Andrews boys?</font></center><P>

The Andrews boys were Gotcha, Warp and I. Warp and I had our computers
in the same room. Gotcha was across the other side of the bathroom but
we yell through the hall keeping in perfect communcation with him. Occassionally, I ran in there and see what's going on :)

Water Combat. That is the true test of a War 2 player. If you want to show
you are a good War 2 player, you have to be good at sea. We skip the land
crap and play sea games. If we didn't, you wouldn't be reading any good
stories because most land games are boring as can be :)<P>

Some say the Andrews boys play water because they can't play land. I say
it's the opposite, we play Water because we know you can't play water.<P>

<center><font size=+2 color=00cc66>What races did the Andrews boys play?</font></center><P>

Well Gotcha usually went Humans, but sometimes went Orcs. Since it's sea, and because Humans are vastly superior to Orcs on the sea, I go Human, except
on Whatkey :) Warp is one of the remaining few players that still always
plays Orcs land & Sea. Only other water players I know that still go
Orcs on Sea is Nate & Denbert.<P>

Next is our 4th game on FOC. Gotcha wasted Summoner with an Invasion. 
First I thing
I see is just nothing left on his island. Aries went big time Sea. there was
some Major Ship battles. Gotcha took out Aries main fleet with Subs.
Flanker then make a HUGE fleet. 10+ Juggs. I got together about 4 sent them in thinking I'd waste them then I see over 10 Juggs. Dang! I got up about 4 Shipyards, went Level 5 Juggs and massed a big fleet. But by the time my fleet
was ready, Warp had killed 4 juggs with one sub, haha. And Gotcha and Warp killed the other Juggs. It was all over. We had a big party in their towns and the game was over. Yet another victory for the Andrews boys.<P>

We played 4on4 on FOC. Shlonglor, Gotcha, Warp, of course & Shaf.
Andrews boys + Shaf vs Lordhelmet, Steel, Gecko and Wermacht. Because
of a game earlier where me, maddawg and warp all played as Warp, they
decided to play as 2 Geckos, A Gecko777 something, and Wermacht. Poor
werm. haha. Their strategy was 2 rush, 2 go juggs. Our Strategy was 4
go Juggs :) Lordhelmet invaded Warp. He did his usually 5 grunt, 1 peon
invasion. He had beat Warp with this invasion 2 times in a row previously,
but this time, Warp got the peon. He beat off the invasion. Werm invaded
Gotcha 2-3 times but he also beat off the invasion. We went down quickly
to one of the geckos that invaded Warp. We knew it was Lordhelmet and we
wanted to prevent more invasions. We quickly got him off the sea. We then
got over to Werm on black's island to stop Werm from invading. We got out
a lot of destroyers and worked until they were all dead. Without the sea, it
was all over for them. One really funny thing that happened was Werm's
transport. He broke out and ran for it. <a href="PICS/werm.jpg"><b>Werm on the run.</b></a> Take a look at that
picture. He had a destroyer from EVERY person on our 4 player game on him :)

<b>Game of the Year, Andrews Boys (11-0)</b></a>(4/2/97)<p>

The Andrews Boys, unfortunately, ended their careers with a loss. It was
all my fault. It was me, Maddawg, Warp, Gotcha vs Silverwolf, NaTe, Khisanth
Shaf. I got Aqua, Maddawg Blue, Warp Yellow, Gotcha Purple. We had all
the worst spots, other than Maddawg. Well we got going and Shaf was in
EARLY on Warp with Juggs. He took him off the sea. I had a Walled in
Guard tower, and just as I was making some Juggs, NaTe invaded me.
But my Guard tower was out of range. Not only did I only have a Guard tower
vs 6 level 3 grunts, but It was outta range. All my peons were killed and
I was out. There was nothing I coulda done. It was a fatal mistake. Had that
been a Cannon tower, the outcome might have been different. With me and
Warp off the Sea, it was Maddawg and Gotcha vs 3 on the sea. There was no
hope. Maddawg played pretty darn good. He pumped out a lot of Juggs
but they couldn't do it 2 vs 3. NaTe set up camp at my Mine, and using
all that gold, he went up to Lust. He Lusted all my teammates to death.
That game was all my fault. Had I protected my mine, helped on the sea,
and not given NaTe all my money, I think we coulda done it. The Andrews
boys went out like a Biotch :)
