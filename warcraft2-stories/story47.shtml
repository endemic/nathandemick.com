I'm fairly new at War2 over Kali. My friend Big Daggy and I (Indigo)had been 
playing one on one for awhile trying to get some practice before launching 
ourselves into the big leagues. Well, tonight Big Daggy was sick so I decided 
to give team play a shot. I entered a game started by Anchove and told 
everyone up front that I had never played teams before.  Everyone was 
supportive, saying that there is a first time for everything, so we started 
the game. It was high resources (for some reason) on spiral, but I can't 
remember what color I was, though it was upper right (like I said, I'm a 
newbie who doesn't have every color on every map memorized). We start going 
and my partner, whose name was REDMAN&Opie or something, sends me helpful 
bits of knowledge like "just start building as much as you can." I'm new at 
partners, but I'm not a complete idiot, so I just said "Uh Huh". I built a 
shipyard and started looking for oil. I had a couple Jugs but I got 
attacked by both players on the other team and my shipyard went down without 
much of a fight. Fortunately, I had just built another shipyard on the other 
side of my island (closer to my oil) so I wasn't too upset. I sent a note 
telling my partner that my shipyard was being attacked and he replied "I can't 
help because I don't have any boats."  I didn't know what he was talking 
about, I figured he just didn't want to part with them.<p>

I was starting to look pretty good, I had a small fleet of Jugs and Subs, had 
just upgraded to Fortress and was staring to turn out Death Knights when my 
partner says "I hate this one. I hate boats."  Well, I was hoping to make a 
joint assault with him and my fleet when I was attacked by the other team. My 
fleet was messing their's up, but they also landed some Ogres on my island and 
I was having trouble fighting both sides at once. Just then I get a message 
that my partner had quit!  No warning, no message, nothing!  My boats did 
their work, but I was screwed on land--mostly from inexperience, I admit. I 
soon surrendered when my fortress was demolished, at Anchove's request. When I 
looked at the stat sheet I noticed that my partner had half the 
gold, half the lumber, and half the buildings that the rest of us had! And 
more incredibly, he hadn't mined any oil!  None. Apparently he had not even 
built a shipyard.<p>

I guess the moral of the story is:  no matter how bad you are, there's always 
somebody worse.<p>

Or maybe it's: don't take advice from someone who doesn't build a shipyard 
because they don't like boats.<p>

But I think the moral is: even if you're a newbie, you should still read 
Shlonglor's etiquette page before screwing with other people's games.<p>

All in all, not a very encouraging introduction to team play.<p>
