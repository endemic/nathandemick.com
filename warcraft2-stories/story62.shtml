I'm sure you all remember the story I had on my main strategy page
about the worst War 2 player ever. Well we have a new champion.<P>

Warp and I were smurfing around.. We were playing High Seas Combat
on High. I went all subs, Warp went Juggs. We happened to get into
a game with a guy named ISDNhomey. The name sounded familar. Gotcha said, hey isn't that guy from IFRAG? If you remember from my War 2 History pages, IFrag
was a program made by Jay Cotton for Doom2. Well as it turned out, this was
the same guy we used to play Doom2 with back in Sept-November 95 right before
War 2 came out. We talked a bit about it. He said those were the good old
days. We said damn right! NO modem dorks like on Kali. Everyone was T1, T3 or
ISDN :) anyway, back to the story...<P>

The guy as red on HSC and if you haven't heard the saying by now, RED=DEAD.
Warp went in with his Juggs and killed Homey's hall. He quit the game.
hahaha. During that time peter448 had his messages on. Newbie! :)
<p>

He starts going: "I need help. I'm out..." I go to Warp, have you attacked him?
He said: "No, I don't even know where his town is." haha. he had come
in pretty early with about 3 destroyers but that's all I saw of him.
If I didn't attack him and Warp didn't then who was attacking him? I quickly
got up to Keep and started pumping Subs. I had about 4 or so of them. I sent
them over and found white. I look at his mine. OH MY GOSH DARN DANNIT!
He had only mined 500 gold! And this was at last 20 minutes into the game. 
I look and he has 4 peons. 1 on gold, 3 on lumber. He had a Smith, a
Mill, and a Barracks. So I set my subs on his shipyard. He took all 4 of
his peons and started repairing the Yard. hahaha Take a look at this picture:

hahah how pathetic. He sat there repairing that yard with 4 subs attacking it until he ran out of lumber. He then put 1 peon on gold and 3 on lumber again.
Man we were laughing so hard. I said to the guy: "have you ever played before?"
He goes: "a little." hahahhahaha I said: "Don't you think you should build
more peons? I have 30-40." He said: "Ok, I'm dead." Warp had quit the game at this time. He didn't want to hang around while I played with the newbie. I
told the guy: "It's not over yet, my partner got killed." hahahaha If
he would have stopped to think, he would have maybe realized who could have possibly killed Warp? haha No one else in the game but me. haha. Well anyway,
I got some Gryphon buildings up. And sent over 4 Gryphons. I had one Gryphon
for each of his peasants. Is that sad or what? hahaha. I clicked on each
peon with a gryphon. haha. He then started to make Axers. At least he knew that Axers could hit Gryphons. I killed his mill and everything but like 1 farm.
He says "ok I think i'm dead." I said: "yeah probably so."<P>

What's even funnier is the stats. This as High resources. I was El Nino.
Just look at the stats for peter. I only have 11 kills that game because
he only made 13 units. haha. Warp's Smurf name was witheld for future use
:)<P>
