You ever have one of those games where no matter what the enemy tried
you had out thought them. You predict their every single move and out think
and out play it. Well those kinda games don't happen too often but when
they do, man they sure make you feel cool about yourself :)<P>

It was me, Gotcha, Vermeer, vs Doomgaze, Wermacht and Beowulf on FOC.
I was Red, Werm Black, Gotcha Orange, Vermeer Yellow, Beo was White,
and Doomgaze blue.<P>

Vermeer was doing his Normandy Invasion order. He landded on Beo and
he was gone. I did an early scout with my tanker and found Werm was
black. Werm only usually does one thing on sea, Rush. So I decided
to do what I never had the courage to do before, Destroyer rush :)<P>
