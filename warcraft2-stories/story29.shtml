Cadaver, Mage, Shlonglor, and Monster^ were playing a war 2 game on
spiral. Mage and Monster^ were teammates. Shlonglor and Cadaver were
teammates. The map was spiral. Cadaver and Shlonglor got their Juggs
together early and attacked Monster's Shipyard.<p>

The second Cadaver and Shlonglor destroyed the shipyard, Monster^ 
<b>QUIT!</b> He quit the game because his shipyard was destroyed! He
left his teammate Mage to fight Shlonglor and Cadaver alone.<p>

What a LLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR!<p>

What kind of person quits a game just because their shipyard is
destroyed? What a bad teammate? I say don't play with Monsters<P>
