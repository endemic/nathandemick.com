Wow!  I played these guys, or at least one of them.  It was me and 
(possibly) Ayyo vs 'HuevoMan' and a partner, who might have been 
CosmoKramer (or perhaps DarthVador...? not sure about that, quite a while 
ago).  Anyway, before the game, one of these guys says no grunt rushing, 
and I say yeah, build town hall first.  Then this guy says 'no attacking 
for a 15 minutes' or something.  What???  Oh, well, this guy's some sort of 
pansy, I'm thinking, so I agree to his crappy rule.  My partner's a bit of 
a newbie, so he soesn't have much to say about it.  I think they mention 
the ogre rule as well.  Anyway, we're expanding, I'm going quite slowly, 
(this is on continent as well) and my partner spots that red has started 
mining white's mine (free slot), so he sends down some guys to attack. 
 Next thing I know, there's a message on the screen saying "no attacking 
secondary town halls!"  I cannot believe my eyes!  Who are these tossers? 
 So this guy is shouting at my partner to back off, and being new and 
inexperienced, my partner says well, ok then and leaves him alone, although 
I'm shouting forget it, just kill him!<p>

	So, it's a bit later in the game, I've moved some peple into the middle 
ready to attack/defend (btw, red is not in the middle cos he built his town 
hall bottom right, obviously so he could be near his teammate, blue), and 
these guys are still saying no attacking yet, wait a while, and I see these 
red sappers running past up to orange's base (my partner).  I shout look 
out, sappers coming, but sure enough a moment later my partner says shit, 
my tower's exploded or something.  I think hmm, I guess we can attack now, 
so I send my guys down to this town hall of red's (in white's spot) and 
start killing peons, and orange follows.  But this guy starts shouting 
again "No attacking 2ndary town halls!  No attacking yet!"  So I just say 
fuck it let's get him, and we erase that hall and the peons.  "You 
bastards" he shouts, "we agreed no attacking!"   And we say "well you 
attacked first," but he says "No it was my teammate!"  "Man I saw those red 
sappers you liar" I tell him.  Anyway he's still shouting:  "You're going 
to pay for that!" he shouts, and a minute later there's some death knights 
in my town decaying stuff, and they get a few buildings, so I rebuild them, 
and he shouts "I told you you'd pay for that!"...<p>

	So to cut a short story even shorter, we kicked their asses and they 
dropped one after the other without even saying anything, never seen them 
since, but it sounds like exactly the same couple of jerks.  No attacking 
secondary town halls!  Amazing!  Watch out for 'em.<p>
