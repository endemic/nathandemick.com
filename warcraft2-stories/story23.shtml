Just for some background, this story takes place right after
the smurfs smurf some more smurf and before the Sapper City story.<p>

This was Muzzy and my 2nd attempt together at smurfing. We were all
in kchat. It seems for the first time ever, I wanted to play more than
Talk. Which is a rarity indeed. Well everyone was there in the #notiwl
channel or something similar. I knew we would never get a 3 on 3 game so
I grabbed Muzzy to go smurfing. I made the messages secret. Well we
decided to head to newbieville. Just to clue you in that is Central
:)<p>

We tried to get some games set up in kchat but no one could understand.
It seems we don't talk their language anymore. Well I decided our only
chance was to serve a game. So Muzzy served it. After a bunch of failed
games because people dropped, we said screw this. I think Castle went
down when we tried to serve another game and Axxis is always down. So we
headed to the new hang out. Starlink. We asked for players there to
take us on. It seems there was someone named Bigbadboss. I asked Bigbadboss
to find a teammate. He decided to pick Vitor. That kind of bugged me
beacause Vitor is good and I wanted to play crappy players. Muzzy and I
were really sure that BigBadBoss really sucked. The guy talked like an
idiot. And every thing he said was in CAPS LOCK! Well Vitor decided to
accept, he joined the game as Grunt Rush.<p>

Background: Vitor seems to be the inventor of the 7 man grunt attack.
It's this new way up whipping out 7 grunts super fast. But he swore us
to secracy about how to do the 7 man grunt attack. And because I don't
want to ruin medium resources forever, I won't tell you how to do it
:)<p>

Anyway we picked Plains of Snow. I'm not sure what resources. Name background: 
Muzzy and I were playing as Gumby and Pokey. But I decided for
some reason to change my name to Corkey. I was orange, Muzzy was Red,
Vitor was black and the boss was aqua.<p>

Well me and Muzzy decided to take out GruntRush with his own game. We
went in together and it was 14 grunts vs 7. He went down. I then headed
to the Boss but found he had some grunts. My grunts went down vs his.
I think Muzzy tried to attack too but failed. Then BadBoss decided
to put up a tower and wall it in. That made me wonder who we were really
dealing with. He wasn't any newbie. Well I went down and kept working on
Vitor's remaining stuff.<P>

But I screwed everything up. I had everyone on gold and noone on lumber.
On top of that, none of my grunts died so I was stuck with too many
guys. I couldn't stop any of the guys on gold to get them on lumber. I
couldn't make any more peons because I didn't have the farms. 
I need farms to make peons to chop wood but I couldn't make farms
without wood and I couldn't get wood because I had no farms!
Damn
recursion. Happens to me all the time when I program. Anyway, I had to
get Muzzy to kill 2 of my grunts so I could make some peons to chop
lumber. It was way into the game and I had about 10,000 gold and 0
lumber. 3 farms and 1 Barracks. That's it. I was screwed big time. 
Muzzy killed my grunts and I made some peons to chop wood.
Well I
just started to get my town rolling when about 15 or so Grunts came into
my town. Level 2 also I think. I had 2! 
So BigBoss took my town. I knew he was some really
good player but Who? Zima? Well I ran and set up another town in
Yellow's spot. I was able to get up a tower and block myself in. I saved
about 4 grunts. Well Muzzy and I decided to attack BIGBAD. We went in
and his tower thrashed us. I went up and got some of his peons. But then
the Ogres came in! I had 3 level 1 grunts. The Ogres were like level 4 or
something. So I went down.<p>

It seems Vitor had one peon left. His peon made a check of all the 
mines. He found my new town. It seems he also forgot messages and I
heard him rat me out. "Corkey's town is defenseless, attack now." Well 
my tower killed the peon and he was eliminated. There is a good reason
to stay in the game till the end. He sure helped the Boss out. Well
then BigBad sends in his grunts and ogres. But my towers held him off.
He decided to sapper me, but as soon as he would destroy something, I
would put something in it's place, so he couldn't get in. Hahahaha.<p>

Well the game was surely over at that point. Muzzy never even got to
Ogres I think. He threw up a bunch of towers in his town for defense. I
was able to sneak a peon out of the siege. I put up some buildings in 
Muzzy's town. I tried putting up a hall by the bottom trees mine. I was
hoping on chopping in. Well BigBad found the hall and attacked it. Then
I think he got some more sappers and I think Death and Decay. About the
time I was going to make my first Ogre, He made it into my second town.
I was gone. We played a little while longer.<p>

It was then that we were really trying to get BigBoss to tell us
who he really was. It was only the last smurf game that Zima had
been disguised as Spiderman. It kinda bugged me. Everytime I made up a
fake name, I would play someone good. Well finally Bigbadboss types
somethink like "master of shadows, emperor of storms" 
or something. I always screw it up.
Anyway that is when I knew who it was. It was.....................
<p><b>StormShadow!</b> Stormshadow was my ex-clan buddy and the same
guy who would later be my teammate in the Sapper City story.<p>

Then Storm explained himself. He was mad that Muzzy and I went smurfing
without him. He felt left out. He wanted to teach us a lesson and he
certainly did that. He said the only way He would forgive me is if I
wrote up the story. Well here it is.<p>

<font color=00cc66><b>Epilog:</b></font> So counting the Sapper city story too, 
that is 3 times i've gone in with
fake names only to meet up with one of my friends doing the same.
I always think i'm playing newbies and it's my friends that beat me up.
DOH! Man will I ever get away with it? I guess I did in the the Taco time
stories.<p>

<font size=+1>Take a look</font></a></center>
at the stats.<p>

Those stats are unbelievable. We got played like newbies. Even 2 on 1,
he thrashed us.<p>
