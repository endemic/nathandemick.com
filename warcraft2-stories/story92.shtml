About two months ago, I was on Kali St. Louis 1, and was well and truly amazed to see a game being hosted by "FOCLow 2v2"  Hmmm, not "freinds.pud" or some combination???  I must not really have been on St Lou 1 :) In any case, I join in, and we await two more.. they were Scru'em and the other guy had a billion symbols, all different colors.... I'll call him Symbols.  <p>
I had purple's spot, while my ally Foc had orange, and so thought, well at least we are close by, so we could send reinforcement troops quite quickly... Unfortunately, Symbols had red at top right (safe foundry) and Scruem had black, bott right.  They too were close by.  <p>
I figured that i'd have to go a lot of sea to survive, seeing as how just about everything i had can be hit by the sea, so I began gearing up for the naval side, while Foc said he was going to go more land...  My base consisted of the standard sea buildings, a cannon tower in the NaTe formation (where did i learn that? :) and a few lev3 grunts for land defence, while i had about 4 juggs or so, i forget what level, and a transport, which was going to go hunt out a free isle :)  Its at this time that i see Symbols is at top right, so i decide to keep him off the sea, and I notify Foc of this, so he could invade..<p>
Then I hear that dreaded beaching sound of a transport landing on my coast...it was symbols' attack..  I figured with a nicely walled in tower, and some grunts,  I ought to repel this...  but he has five level five grunts, and a cata... crap!!  a catapult... he puts his cata up against some of my trees, and "stops" his grutns around it, shielding it from attack..  My grunts foolishly attack when his cata hits strike my tower (in range too, as if!!) so they die fast.. he makes short work of my tower, and I tried to stave off this attack, I even cancelled a jugg to have enough gold to make more grunts...  to no avail.. <p>
I had radioed Foc, but his guys got there too late, he was finishing off my hall while patrolling for peons...  I was done for, but at least my juggs had not only taken out his transport, but was trying to hit his soldiers on my isle, plus i had two keeping him off of the sea..  He must not have had enough oil to upgrade to castle and go for mages, because he never did, so my juggs then covered Focs troops as they invaded Symbols.. he built a tower and barracks, and was able to eventually take out the inland stuff that my pissed off juggs couldnt reach.. <p>
The situation was this.. I had no more buildings essentially, i still had a transport with a peon on board, but had only 987 gold... and i had an oil rig, four tankers, and one shipyard remaining, as well as four or five juggs, but at least symbols was dead..  I figured, i could at least check the mines with Mr peon, and harass Scruem, who was by now getting big...Now it was a 1 on 1.5, symbols left the game... he was out...<p>
But now, scruem was nice and powerful, and my juggs kept seeking out his stupid transports, and once in a while, i would find one of his expansions, and hammer it from the sea if i could...  but scruem was ahead in technology, and it didnt look good for us.  Still, I had a transport, and some gold, i figured i could help out the defence of Foc's base.  Too bad i didnt have enough gold for a stupid town hall, then i could rebuild and get enough resources for more juggs, and some anti tranny destroyers...<p>
And thats when my rig finally dried up, and guess what?  Those tankers actually DISMANTLE the rig, it doesnt just blow up.... Hmmm, i was unaware of this before..  but it DID give me enough to build a town hall...<P>
I messaged Foc this, and he said soemthing to the effect of, hurry the hell up, he is hitting my expansion at Aqua (left middle) and i am barely holding him back.... It was now a race to get back up to speed, after getting going at blue (top left), but my dilemma was, do i get troops?  Then he would know for sure i was back in the game, or should i go for shipping, where i could keep him off sea (maybe) and gamble that he wouldnt notice my "regenerating" ships :)  <p>
Well, i immediately went for more destroyers, to kill scruems transports, and once i had enough resources, went back and expanded at my original isle!! It was the best spot for important buildings, because scruem for sure didnt expect me back there :)  <p>
To make an already too long story shorter, my getting back into the game gave us that edge to turn the tides our way, and before finishing off the last of scruems main, while my grunts (i never went for upgraded hall :) were bashing apart his expansion halls...scruem messages us:  I thought you were dead, DenM...How did you come back?  So i told him about my rig giving me back "my deposit" and that gave me enough resources to build a hall....
In an otherwise fairly even one vs one battle, its cool that a small thing as a money back guarantee on my rig was able to bring us to victory!!!!!

<P>
