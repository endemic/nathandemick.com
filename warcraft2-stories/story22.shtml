I guess all that stuff is full of crap but it looks cool =:-)<p>

After losing to the massive sapper attack (see the sapper city story)
, I was quite impressed with
that strategy. I found Muzzy in Kchat, my smurf buddy, haha, and I told
him the story. We decided to go smurfing (smurfing means go make up
names and kill newbies or intermediate players). This was maybe an hour
or so after the Sapper City Story. Well Muzzy and I decided to try
the massive sapper strategy.<p>

Before I start, let me tell you about the taco deal. The other day,
someone, Chanman I think, told me and Muzzy that people are calling
Goblin Alchemists Taco bells. So Muzzy and I have taken to calling them
taco bells too, haha.<p>

Well we made up our names. I'm partial to Cap'n'Crunch and GoldenGrams
so I made up the names :). We decided to serve a game and wait to see
who joins. Well dcengr and Bomb decided to join. I was a bit afraid of
the name Bomb, especially after playing sapper and kaboom. I made the 
sugguestion that the cereals should be partners. The other two agreed
to be partners. But they said we will team if we feel like it. I think
they thought they were so good that they didn't need any partner. haha.<p>

Well We started out. It was the maze on medium resources. I was quite
scared. I didn't think I could pull the sapper strategy off. Well I
made about 3 guard towers into the entrance of my village as soon as I
could. Then I walled in the bottom entrance with Farms. I upgraded
to Stronghold. As soon as I hit stronghold, I whipped out 2 Taco Bells.
I made 2 more when I got the chance. About that time, Bomb dropped. 
Then two sappers popped out. I sent them straight down to Dcengr.
I took out his barracks and farms. I kept sending in the sappers 4 at a
time. I made some more taco bells.<p>

So Dcengr decided to send in everything he had against my town. But he
had to walk through about 5 guard towers. He didn't last long.
It was then that Muzzy sent in a huge amount of sappers, 9 maybe?
And totally obliterated his entire town. Dcengr was left with about 4 or
so peons. It was then that I chased them down with sappers and he was
eliminated.<p>

I was quite surprised that it worked so well. Sure I admit it was
totally no fair to Dcengr. 2 on 1 and all that. He was pretty nice. He
didn't get mad or anything. So that game was over and QUICK!<p>

<hr size=2 width=90%>

Well Muzzy and I were saying man this worked so well let's try it in a 2
on 2 game. So we served it and Apollo and Coldblood showed up. We did
the same thing. I was red and Muzzy was Black. Coldblood was orange and
Apollo was blue. Maze on medium again.<p>

We did the same thing. I built arrow towers to prevent attack. I built 4
taco bells and started pumping out the tacos :). I sent them in. They
were quite surprised. I didn't really kill anything cool. I had big
problems getting them there and to get anything.<p>

It was then that Coldblood figured out what we were doing. He goes why
are you guys only building sappers. Of course we just laughed to
ourselves and said nothing. I whipped out some more taco bells and was
making tacos like crazy. I sent in like 5 sappers at a time. I kept
getting his towers before he could upgrade them or after he just built
them. It was then that Coldblood started getting really mad. Muzzy and I
were laughing so hard. Coldblood starts going "Cheap really Cheap." We
didn't say anything but kept laughing.<p>

Coldblood kept leaving his messages on by mistake. He says to Apollo,
send berzerkers, they are sending in tons of sappers. So we laugh some
more. Then Apollo decided to attack me with some footmen and a bunch of
archers. He attacked my weak side. I thought I was pretty much gone but
he decided to attack my towers which wasted him. I had my peons wacking
on his guys too :). Grunts? Hell no.<p>

Then I discovered that Orange had a new Hall. I informed Muzzy and sent
over 4 sappers. I got there and ran through Coldblood's peons who were
trying desperatly to attack my sappers :). Muhahahahhaha. I took his
hall. He was pretty mad. It was starting to get nasty between us.
Muzzy was just laughing. Coldblood was pissed beyond belief. Saying all
manner of things about us. haha.<p>

So then I was really screwed. I ran outta gold. I had to do the peon
gold train to get enough money for a hall. But I finally got the money
and started building even more taco bells and sappers. I then amassed a
huge group of sappers. I ran in and took out lots of his good stuff.
Muzzy followed me in and got rid of almost everything in Cold bloods
town. He had huge armies of Sappers. haha.<p>

I guess Coldblood tried to rebuild his 2nd hall. I flew over and saw
that Muzzy had set up some towers next to it so the peons could not mine
and so they hit the hall. Man Coldblood didn't seem to like that either.
<p>

Well I was finished with Coldblood pretty much so I took a look at
Apollo. Muzzy had a Taco bell in apollo's town. Apollo was beating on
it with footmen I belive. He got rid of the taco bell in his town. I
guess Apollo hates tacos. hahahahaha :)<p>

I sent a peon down to build a Taco bell of my own near his town. Then Muzzy
and I noticed that Apollo was taking all his guys and going somewhere
else. He decided to head to my town. He came in and started beating on
my towers. I made 1 grunt and peon attacked his guys. I took him down.
It was at that point he left the game I believe. I made another grunt
and went up and attacked the few farms left in Coldblood's Original
town. I had my sappers attacking the farms instead of destroying them,
haha.<p>

Well I guess Muzzy's tower at oranges hall got destroyed or something.
So I sent my 2 grunts and sapper up to take the hall. I was beating on
it with 2 grunts and a sapper. It was then Coldblood made some remark
about my level 1 grunts. I said "blacksmith, who needs it?" He said
something like that's really cheap. I was sorta getting mad, so I go
"Well if cheap is kicking your ass, call me cheap." I also told him the
exact thing was done to me today and I didn't get mad. He also said
something about I'm an idiot for killing his hall instead of his peons.
Well What did I care? We had that game. I had like 25 sappers around.
Any new hall he could have built would be gone just like that. So I 
got rid of the hall and some peons.<p> 

It was then that I discovered that
He had one Berzerker and some grunts roaming the map. I chased him down
with a few sappers and peons. I killed all of his guys but a grunt with
a sapper blast. I then finished off the last level 5 grunt with a bunch
of peons. Coldblood didn't seem to happy to have peons taking him down.
"Peons? you must be joking" he said.<p>

That game was so much fun. It's much more fun when you are the ones
making the tacos instead of eating them :).<p>

Muzzy had Taco bells all across the whole map. He opened a regular chain of
them :).<p> 
<hr size=2 width=90%>
Well Coldblood was quite mad. He thought Muzzy and I were a couple of
losers that need tricks to beat people. So he said he would take us both
out 2 on 1. We had quite a laugh over that. He served the game. He
then changed his mind and decided he needed a partner. He grabbed the
first one to show. Casper. We played Crossover on low. I was white.
Muzzy blue, Casper yellow and Coldblood was orange.<p>

Muzzy and I decided to mass grunt Coldblood to show him who is boss.
I got out a bunch of grunts. I decided to go up and attack Casper
instead. But Crossover blows so I got lost. I decided to attack
Coldblood instead. It was then Muzzy informed me that He had taken
out Coldblood's grunts. I ran in with mine and it was about then that
Coldblood said the game was over. I didn't believe him and continued to
hack on his town. I then go "hmm level 2 grunts?" He was making fun of
mine last time. It was then that he told us about his hall. If you play
orange, you got to mine a million miles from your hall. He was right, he
was screwed from the beginning.<p>

We then went in on Casper. Muzzy said something about Casper only have 1
grunt to defend himself. I came in with the ogres and took him out.
Sometime around then, Coldblood figured out I was Shlonglor. I told him
GoldenGrams was Muzzy. He surrendered and we went to kchat.<p>

After a long time talking in kchat about everything, I think Coldblood
stopped being mad. I think we became friends after that. So Coldblood is
ok. Just like me, he needs not to get mad at War 2 games.<p>

Well that is the story. I learned that the defense against a million
sappers is to get those guys before they get the sappers. I think you
might want to take out the peons mining and chopping. If you let them
get up 4 or so Taco bells, then you are probably screwed. Attack them
before they make the stuff.<p>

That day was so much fun.
We went from getting sappered by Azure and Marshall, to doing it to someone
else. We shared the fun, haha. <p>
