Here are some guidelines about submiting stories. If I do like your story,
I will tell you so, I will put it on the page with your name at the bottom
and whatever links you want added (if any). If I don't like your story,
I will simply say, sorry but I am not interested in your story. Please
don't be mad at me for rejecting your story. Less than 10% of the stories
submited ever make it on the story page. That is mostly due to people
not knowing what is a story game and what isn't.
<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Only pick GOOD games to write about.</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
The problem with most people's stories is they write story about
just any game. If you look around the web at people's attempt to
Duplicate Shlonglor's Story page success, you will find that most
Story pages really suck. There are only a few good ones. Why? Because
most people write about just any game. It takes a good amazing, out of
the ordinary game to write a story about. There are various examples of
this in my story page list, "Love them Scotts", "Sapper City", "Elven Magic",
all of those stories were totally amazing and original in their day. They
changed the way people played and looked at War 2.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Please no FFA, Friends Hellpud, stories.</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
Those stories are usually pretty darn boring and unoriginal. Hellpud is one
big totally unfair pud too.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>More about what type of games to write about.</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
Man at least win the game in the story. It really sucks to read some story
that's going along pretty good to get to the end to read, gee and I lost.
WHAT! If you lost in some spectacular way, ok but otherwise. Usually 1on1
stories are pretty boring too. It's the big team game stories that end up
being the most exciting, such as the game of the year story on the 
andrews boys page. You need to learn to know which is a story game and which
isn't. Almost 90% of people it seems don't know what a story game is
and which isn't. You can't just write about any game. It's gotta be something
different or something outta the ordinary, or at least something funny.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>No Stories that teach Bad Strategy.</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
These idiots keep sending me stories where they played bad and their
enemy played bad, but they played a little less bad than their enemy
so suddenly that's a good game? I mean the story goes like, I made a bunch
of gryphons and they kept getting killed by Mages, so I made some more
gryphons and they kept getting killed and eventually I lost. What kinda
strategy is that teaching? The people don't even realize why they lost
the game? uH mages? Making more Gryphons when they got Mages? What is
that teaching anyone? I'm looking for stories that can teach a new
strategy or at least shows 2 people using good strategy on each other.
Or at least a funny story where people talk about how they both were playing
bad or something. Take a look at the story votes. You can see stories that
bomb and ones that make it. Yet people aren't able to judge their
only stories for their crappiness.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Tell the WHOLE story.</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
Most people say stuff like "He attacked me with grunts, I fought them off with mine" How many grunts? What level? What level were yours? How many did
you have? These are all details people want to know. When you write a
story you have to go into every detail as it happened. To do this, you
usually have to write a story right after the game happens, that is
unless you have a really good memory. Another thing people like to
do is leave out most of the story. They cut out huge parts of the
story and just end it right in the middle.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Make bloody sense.</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
You need to have some sort of writing ability in the first place
when you write stories. I'm sure you've looked around at other pages
and have seen people who are not good at writing stories. You either
have it or you don't. Not everyone is a Story teller.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Don't be making stuff up.</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
This isn't fiction hour. Tell the facts as they happen.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Make sure it's
correct when you send it.</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
I don't have time to proofread your story. If I like it, I'll put it up
as it is. Cut and paste. I probably won't take the time to fix any
spelling or whatever mistakes you have in your story.<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>If possible, make it HTML ready</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
If you could, please seperate the paragraphs with &lt;p&gt; that way
I won't have to manually enter them between your paragraphs. Just simply
put a &lt;p&gt; at the end of each paragraph. I'll add the rest of
the html code myself. Relating to that.......<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Have a least 2 paragraphs!</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
Come on, a story doesn't entirely fit into one paragraph! Use some
of them english skillz you got in dat english class. :)<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Watch the freakin' cuss words!</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
This site has enough bad languge on it without you adding to it.
Please try to clean up your language for them little kiddies who
read the stories :)<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Make your line short and hit return after
every line</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
I keep getting these stories that people send me that have no carriage
returns in it, as in the enter key. I get this story that is all on one line
going off forever to the right. This makes the story impossible to
edit and it often chokes my editor because it can't display that
many characters on one line. If you send me stories like that, expect to 
never hear from me again :)<P>

<font color=00cc66 size=+1>Don't send me pictures unless I ask for them!</font><br>
<img hspace=8 src="../PICS/LOGO/dot_clear.gif">
If I like your story and accept it, I will ask for some photos you got
to go with it. But unless I ask, don't send them. My mail account isn't
that big.<P>
