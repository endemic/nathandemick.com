I just got finished the wierdest game i've ever played. Oh by the way this
is a SHORT story. I got into a game with 4 others, it was a 2v3. The game was
lagged, bad. I select my peon and have him go to build the town hall. Just as I
hear the "choonk" of him starting to build someone droppes and my peon
dissapears. The fog settles and boom i'm at the defeat sequece. It must have
been funny as hell for the other players to see "Player LC-Grape was
eliminated." in the first 5 seconds of the game hahaha.
Who says a story can't be one paragraph. :)<p>
