I was playing a game on kali the other day, and one of your
older strategy page stories won me the game.  I was playing 
on Islands in the stream. I was in the top 
position, and I had one opponent who was in the right bottom
position. Knowing that I was screwed in this setup because
he didn't need to make any sea power to get the other mines,
I went to shipyard/foundry/transport as soon as possible.
<p>
I had guys across setting up town hall and barracks next to
the mine on the left side empty position.  I made the 
mistake however of not making any grunts first 
(I underestimated my opponent).  He knew where I had to go,
and had grunts (level 2) there before my barracks were even
done.  He wiped that out.  I started to make a few juggs,
but on that map (narrow rivers) catapults can just destroy
any ships cus ships have nowhere to run, while the catapults
can move out of reach.  After losing shipyards on both left
and right sides of my island, I was trapped.  I upgraded to
get goblin zepps, and went scouting.  He was draining 
3 mines.<p>

Knowing that I was beat, I remembered a story
I read on your page about someone you and Gotcha played who
made griffins - lots of griffins.  Instead of surrendering,
I hit the sencond mine on my starting island with a vengeance.
I made six berzerkers (upgraded damage only) with a couple
of ogres to bloodlust them.  They were positioned to take
out any of his zepplins.  I took out three of them before
he gave up and sent the message "ok. whatever, I don't need
to see you.  You know I already won right? Just surrender."
I replied "yea, but I'm going to make you finish me off - 
I'm ready for your invasion." He replied "towers and death
knights huh? whatever, I'll destroy you!!!"<p>

Other than the
six archers and two ogres for taking out his zepps, I had
no ground forces and no towers.  After that round of 
messages, I was just about finished with the other mine on
my island.  I immediately made 4 roosts, and started pumping
dragons like crazy.  Now ordinarily, I never ever make dragons
cus they suck.  I was playing someone that I played many
times before, so he knew that.  I had four zepps which I 
used to scope him out totally.  He had mostly ogres with
four barracks pumping (he was building up to really pound me)
He had 1 lumber mill and 2 temples with one castle.  As my
dragons were coming out I made 2 death knights and researched
one spell - Haste.  He was still building tons and tons of
ogres and had started on 2 shipyards and one foundry for
transports.  He still had made no more zepplins.<P>

When my
money ran out, I had 23 dragons - he had six transports and
more ogres than I could guess.  Since he figured he had already
won, he was going to try to embarrass me.  I hasted and 
bloodlusted as many dragons as I could, and sent them straight
for his castle.  He messaged "You've got to be kidding"  I
ignored it, and put 13 dragons on his castle, six on one 
temple that he had near his castle, and 5 chasing after his
death knights.<p>

I saw that he immediatly started loading his
men onto his transports and sending them across.  While he
had the ogres waiting on my shore for his transports to
make another trip, I attacked them, just to make it
look like I cared about my home base.  He started attacking,
and I never looked at my home base again.  I lost a few
dragons to his death knights before I took down his castle and
temple.  After that I sent 9 dragons after his second temple
and 6 dragons after his lumber mill, and the rest to support
the dragons on the temple by attacking any death knights that
approached (the whole time I was ignoring the sounds of my
entire city being decimated).<p>

After he lost his only remaining
temple and lumber mill, I went after the other lumber mill
that he was putting up while sending most of my dragons to his
city halls. One by one I destroyed all his city halls, and 
went looking for any new ones.  I took out two new city halls
and took out one destroyer that he made as a silly last ditch
effort (four dragons took care of it real quick).<P>

By this
time I had lost my last farm; I had no buildings left and no
troops except for 6 dragons - my last units.  I had destroyed
all his town halls, and all the peons that I could see when
I noticed a little red dot moving down the screen next to one
of my zepps.  It was a peon carrying wood!  I followed it.
The little guy got on a transport.  I followed that until it
came to the little island on the lower left of the screen.
He had a town hall there!  Not for long... ;) After I took
out that town hall, and his last peon, he surrendered.  He
still had about 70+ ogres but no peons and no town halls.
We talked in the chat room, and he kept repeating "I should
have made more zepplins!"  Yep, if he knew I was making
dragons, he could have easily beat me.  I had zepps and
knew exactly where his lumber mill and 2 temples were. 
<P>
The moral of this story I guess is 'surveillance is everything'!
I got that idea from your story about how much trouble you
guys had with the guy who made nothing but tons of griffins.
