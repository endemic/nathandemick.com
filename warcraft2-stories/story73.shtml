We got together another game on Whatkey. It was Me, Gotcha, Silverwhore
vs Shaf, Wermacht, Stormshadow.<P>

We had the little battle in the middle. We won like always. Gotcha and
Silverwolf commited sucide and I was stuck with an Ogre in the middle.
Doh.<P>

Gotcha and Silverwolf got bottom right. I got Top middle, nowhere near
them. I knew I was surrounded. Crap! The game got underway, I did
my little farm farm barracks crap. In came shaf with footmen. He had
like 2, and I had 1. Crap. I was able to beat off the invasion. I got
another barracks up. I set up a 2on1 on the right, but no one came. So
I decided to head right with 2 grunts. No one was next to me, so I made
probably the biggest mistake in the game. Rather then setting up a 2on1
at the empty spot, I went right thinking somehow I could get Werm. Silverwolf
was attacking him from the other side I think. But I run with my 2 grunts, after
killing maybe 1 or 2 peons, into like 6 level 2 grunts. Those grunts
immediately headed left and took the empty spot. Which wouldn't have happened
had I the 2on1 set up. DOH. I made the mistake of attacking Shaf's footmen.
He had in the trench with 1 grunt and 2 axers. My footmen went down, then
my axers. Stupid! I had a footmen with 2 axers behind him. But the footmen
went down. So in runs shaf with some guys. I was able to beat it off, but
just then in comes werm from the right. He had like 4 or so level 3 grunts.
I had a 2on1 set up with my grunts. After losing a few grunts, Werm decided
to head home. Around then, I had my cannon tower up. Just then in comes
a transport with like 6 Shaf footmen. They went straight for my smith.
I grabbed 3 footmen from the right, risky move, where they had the 2on1 set up
to fight Werm, I then grabbed a few grunts from my barracks. I was able
to take Shaf's footmen.<P>

I don't have a clue what Gotcha and Silver were doing. Gotcha had the sea
I guess. But he wasn't able to stop Shaf's transports. Werm was all the way
up to Lust and Dks already. I was screwed. I quickly got up to Ogres,
then lust and dks. During that time, my Ogre in the middle got killed
by a Shaf tower. Looked like he was on middle. I had a couple of dead
grunts. So I sent one around through the trench to Shaf's town, I was
able to kill some peons. hahaha. My grunt had like 2 hit points. I
did the thing again, haha. killed a few more.<P>

I got on the sea, Werm tried to sneak some Grunts over to my side to block
the passage. I d&ded them. He tried to send over 2 Dks, but he wasn't watching
them. I charged them with peons and grunts and they went down. hahahahah.
But Werm had grabbed the mine right of me. Shaf was left of me, AND Werm 
was right of me. Storm had grabbed another mine left of Gotcha or so.
So Where were we going to get gold? Crap hahaha.<P>

I had lusted ogres and dks. I looked over at Shaf's town and he didn't
even have a walled in tower. So I rushed in with lusted Ogres and
took his whole town. He was going to castle but he canceled. I got
his keep, his stables, all his cool stuff, and I got rid of everything
but the farms.<P>

I was feeling like we might possibly have a chance. 1 down, 2 to go.
UNTIL, I flew over and there is Shaf in the middle
with a whole other town. CRAP! 
<P>

Soo. Gotcha is in trouble. I had to
send in like 3 Ogres and an axer to bail him out. While my guys are
on the way, someone dropped. I forgot who. I ran into Gotcha's room.
We worked out our game plan. They had the middle and Gotcha had
sea. So our only chance was to get the middle. I had 2 dks and
our plan was for Gotcha to put his ships on the left side of middle.
I would then send a transport over with Dks. I would hop out,
Decay the middle, then run back into the transport, with the
Juggs laying down grazing fire. I was able to decay most of
the towers. I got my 2 other transports and got all the Ogres
that were killing Shaf's town. I took the other transport and got
The Ogres and axer that was protecting Gotcha. I landed on the
left of middle. I lusted and ran in. I was able to pretty much gain
control of the island. Shaf still had a barracks pumping but I took
out his stables. Shaf ran in with either a Knight or Footmen
and took my last ogre. But I figured Gotcha and Silver could
come in and finish the rest off.<P>

Just then...In comes Werm and Storm with Lusted Ogres and Dks. DOH.
The island was there again. I was left with like 6 peons and a transport.
When I wasn't looking, my transport was sunk with the dks in it. I think
shaf sunk it with guys on the shore beating on it. Shaf sunk another
one of my transports too.<P>

Almost immediately after I took my 3 transports out. In came werm
from the right with a bunch of lusted Ogres. My town was a gonner.
But it wasn't my town anymore. I didn't need it. I had moved out.
I was on the road with my 3 transports. haha.<P>

Well I ran with all my peons to shaf's town. Werm was having his way
with my town. I love it when you move out of a town and people attack
it and think that it's hurting you. I didn't care. He could have it.
Shaf was probably thinking the same thing when I was in his first town :)<P>

Well Gotcha and Silverwolf battled in the middle. I think they did
some big time damage. I had 1 transport like 8 peons left. I stuck
6 in the transport and went to the middle island. I built my
hall on the shore. Of course that island wasn't under our control.
Shaf was there still along with more people. But I did it as
sort of a joke haha. Shaf discoverd my hall on the shore and the jig
was up. I grabbed my peons repairing my hall and started attacking his peons.
hahaha. It was peon battle part 3. This time, I was kicking his butt.
haha. I lost my peons and went back to get the other 2 or so I left
in Shaf's old town.<P>

Gotcha and Silver came in. I think Gotcha was building a tower or something.
I took my peons and started attacking Shaf's mill. My one goal was
to take that mill and I got it haha. Take a look at the following picture.<P>

Shaf sent in a Knight after me. I think Silver was nice enough to slow
him for me :) I still didn't win that battle tho.<P>

During this time, Storm had gotten on the sea and he went and invaded
my old town. WHO CARES. I think he thought he was hurting me too. Gee
it's not like werm hadn't visited my town allready :) Storm loaded up
his Ogres and 2 dks from my town and went to the middle. He regained
control of the island and killed my hall :(<P>

That game was a lot of fun. Looking at the stats, it's easy to see
that I did damn good for having no money. Gotcha and Silverwolf played
like crap. It was all me :) Screw you guys!<P>

In a side note, gotcha played so crappy because he built a farm 
in the top left corner of his hall where the peons pop out. IDIOT.
So when the peons popped out, they had to walk around the farm
to mine gold. That is what killed him.<P>
