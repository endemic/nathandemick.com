I was sitting in Kchat minding my own business when fucknutz Vertigo asks
me to play a game. I said kindly: "No thanks" so he starts saying he can beat
me blah blah. He was talking all this trash..
You can't play. Now if you hang around
me, you know this has happened all day long for every day for a over a year.
But I was tried of taking this losers shit. SO I said, ok punk you and me
1on1 lets go. He was spouting off about how high is what real players play.
Which only shows how stupid ass this fool is. I said how about Spiral High?
I said or One way in on low. He agreed to Spiral on High. I served the game.
I set up high on Spiral and he goes: "I thought you wanted One way in on Low?"
So I go: "Fine." and I put it on Low on One way in. I then said starting and
began the game.<P>

I did my building and got together 3 Grunts. I walked over to his town
and look what I found:<P>

haha check that crap out. He is attempting a Nate formation (gee wonder where
he learned that) but his barracks wasn't even done yet! What an idiot. If
you are doing that crap, you go mill 3rd, and you certainly don't build a
tower that early. You wait until 4 farms are done at least. So I set
up this little thing on him...<P>

I set up a 2on1 on his barracks and one Grunt to kill his peons. Eventually
he was able to kill about 3 of my grunts. I was able to take over 10 grunts
with those 3 Grunts. Pretty damn good trade I would think. The idiot kept
pumping grunts even tho I have a 2on1 set up. NEWBIE!
He had a lot of gold stored up
it seemed. He got a peon and ran to my village. He noticed that I had
only 2 farms and a Barracks. He starts crying farm farm barracks? haha What
a newbie ass. Everyone who is anyone does farm farm barracks or farm barracks
farm on land. That crap has been going on since Summer 96. It's what you do.
He starts screaming cheap cheap cheap and talking all this shit. What
is it wrong to kick someone's ass? hahah. He goes I didn't know you were
going to play like that. Gotcha who was watching said: "You mean to win?" hahaha. Looking at this dilweed newbie's order he thought I'd come in about
20 minutes later. He was playing SIM CITY. I mean what kind of moron goes
farm farm farm tower barracks? I mean last time I checked you need a
smith or mill to upgrade a tower. haha. So this fool starts talking about
how I suck at grunt rushing, I'm a crappy grunt rusher. Well Looking at
the stats, how can I be crappy with grunts If I kicked his ass so bad?
<P>

Look at those stats. That newbie trash talking bitch got his ass SKOOLED.
hahahah. I passed out the pictures and all of kali was laughing for an
hour. Vertigo then tries to say, that I can only play 2 maps, spiral and
one way in. He even went over to the Cases message board and talked shit
about me. He claims I can only play 2 maps. He only played me one map
hahaha. So how would he know? haha. Well like he had anything to talk about. 
He got taken down like the newbie he is.<P>

VertiGo Reg Number 86994. If this is what a Cases ladder person is,
what a bunch of losers. Next time you see VertiGo (And make sure it's the
right one there are 5 of them) tell him: 
<font color=red><b>"Hey VertiGo: Shlonglor SKOOLED
your ass like the Newbie you are!"</b></font><P>

Hears exactly 
what happened! I was at starlink trying to find a NWL match when this guy, Shlonglor 
is talking about he is the greatest War2 God to ever play with mortals. So I just 
jokingly Challenged him with something like "Oh yeah, Bet I could Kill you!!" He 
acepts it and we play! He won because we played on one of the only two maps he can 
play on...One way In, One way Out on Low res...! We then go back to chat and he 
starts talking all this shit about how I suck and I'm a newbie and crap! So I'm not 
going to back down and start in also, then his friends start in too! It wasn't the 
fact that I lost to him just that he is a cocky bastard!!<br>

Hahahahha. What a load of crap. This had to be documented. I sure as hell
wasn't talking about how i'm the War 2 god, haha. And he certainly
wasn't joking about the Kill you crap. And that's now why I won. I won
cuz he sucked hahah.
