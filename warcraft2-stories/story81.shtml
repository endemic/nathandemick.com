I) Goodbye my friends.....
<p></font></b>

My fellow countrymen and fellow ogres.... Today I announce that I will no
longer be a part of IWL or anyother ANYTHING online. This is due to some
personal decisions, I no longer have the desire to spend 4 to 8 hours a day
on kali, the Web, or anything other time-consuming-adictive program. As far
as I know I am one of the first kali-addicted-players (if not the first) to
attempt to go offline:) , and venture back into the real world. Wish me
luck!!
<hr size=2 width=90%>
<font color=00cc66><b>
II) What I leave you with.....
</font></b>

The following is a list of all my worthy virtual-ideas or possestions and
who I have left them too.
<P>
IWL leadership -I had many fun times on IWL, but I personally belive that
the 2nd reset just killed the IWL. I have been in it since the begining,
and saw what the 1st reset did, but what is left of it I chose to give to
FOSS who had a vital part in making Blackrock what it once was. If FOSS
does not want the leadership then it should go down the ladder until
someone accepts the responsibility for it.
<P>
My strategies for Nowhere to run Nowhere to hide - Allthough I never
released my full strategies for this level, I leave them in the hands of
White and FOSS to do what they please with. To all you newbie war2 players
out there who think this is a shitty level because it small, I say to YOU.
You are a shitty player because you cannot come up with more than 1 or 2
strats for this level!!!! Ruuuuuuuuuuuuhahaahahha!
<P>
The ONE thing that I know of that could cause the TOTAL destruction of WAR2
as we know it - I intrust this SECRET to Shlonglor, who has always been a
good online bud of mine. He had a large part in making war2 what it is
today on kali. He is among a circle of my kali friends that have been
around, what seems forever, and have always enjoyed eachothers company...
whether it be in war or just chatting. This awsome responsibility I place
on Shlonglor because he is the one guy that did more than ANYONE else to
make war2 "happen" on kali. You could say that he gave birth to war2 on
kali, and now I invest in him, the power to TOTALLY DESTROY WAR2 ON KALI.
Please don't email Shlonglor asking him about it, if I know Shlonglor, I
know that if he CHOOSES to tell anyone he will! But he will not just tell
you because you ask him about it (hahaha hex!!!) So to all you war2 players
out there who go into a game and act like an ass, return to chat, cuss, and
are just overall bad sportmen/ogres. YOU better start acting good or else
Shlonglor might just KILL war2:) Ruuuuhahahhahaa!
<P>
As a special parting gift to all who recieve this email, I will also send
my special kchat.cfg file which contains all my beautiful macros that I
have annoyed you with throughout the history of kali..... :)

</font></b><P>

Ok well thats what I leave to you guys, I hope you enjoy them!!! Below Is
the history of my gaming, kali, IWL and War2 as "I" remember it .....
<P>
<font color=red><b>
A) The early years................
</font></b><p>

Well I guess I have always loved games from the begining. My first ever
game machine was an atarii "pong" consul. Yes a consul! It came with a
"motherbox" and two huge controlers that were permitally attached to the
consul. It was great! You could play pong, tennis, basketbal, ect.. of
course there were no carterages just a selector switch :) and NO cartrages
:) Eventually atarii released the atarii 2600. It was the first
breakthrough in gaming. I loved the 2600 and had many games for it. WOW
cartrages!! what a concept :) Among my favorite games were "mazecraze" and
"battle tanks" .. oh yeah "astroids" and "space invaders" haha.. Then I was
amazed by my neibors Clecovision!! It was way cool and had good graphics :)
cant remeber much else. Eventually after working for my grandmother (for
money haha) I saved up enough money for a atarii 5600 :) WOW!! This was a
slick machine, my favorite game on it was digdug :) (I never could get ALL
the dirt dug up! A few years went by and then I bough a nintindo. Man
nintindo blew the roof off of anything else on the market. It was simply
the best game system of its time. The one game I remember from nintindo was
Ultima :) an rpg that I spent LOTS of time on ohh yeah also "Dragonlord"
(no not on kali :) After the nintindo I bought a sega genisis, which I
enjoyed very much, until I got my supernintindo. BTW, the thing I notice
about SEGA vs NINTINDO is that sega had some cool sports games, but in
general Sega always came out with machines tooooooo early (I dont think
they did any market research) and Nintindo seemed to wait and come out with
a quality machine. This fact was even proven further when Sega released the
SHITTY cd rom adapter that I paid 300+ for and it sucked!!!!
<p>
<font color=red><b>
B) The Warcraft days....................................
</b></font><P>

Well after years went by and 32 bit systems and some 64 bit ones were
comming out I started looking @ computers :) And eventually got one an at&t
P60 :) of course, it was out of date before payments were done :) I then
started looking for games!! And after years or months (cant remeber) I
found WARCRAFT, but I did not buy it :) But every time I went into a store
I looked at it and looked at it and looked at it haha. And eventually I
bought it!! I did not however, ever play it over modem or kali. But I beat
the HUMAN (haha) senerio. One funny thing was ... I did NOT know that you
could select more than one unit at a time.. so I beat the game by FREAKEN
SELECTING ONE GUY AT A TIME ruuuhahah!

<font color=red><b>
C) The War2 days.................................
</font></b><p>

<font color=855e42><b>
i) Getting hooked up.
</b></font><P>

Well it was about that time when war2 came out. Of course as soon as I saw
it I rushed to the store and bought it! About the same month (or before) I
remeber my going over to my geek friends house (haha donny! aka DrDon) and
watching him play some 3d game called Descent. I never really like it too
much. But he was determined to get me hooked up to kali! So he told me how.
Then in a week or so I went to cyberhighway (in Boise Idaho) and got hooked
online. If I had only know what was to come...... . . .
<P>
My first nick on kali (as my friends so fortuantly name me when setting up
kali for me) was .. get this... "Newbie" haha !!! at least it wasn't
"Icecube" or whatever rapper yours was shlongy :) Well those were the kali
Central days!! I remember them well. I was always getting kicked off after
15 min because I hadn't registered.. So I called up and registered by
credit card.. but Jay never sent me my # ... so what did I do? haha I
caught JayC on kchat and /msg him and told him about it!!! (like you could
do that anymore) haha YES Jay used to come on all the time ! But STILL no
#... so I finally emailed him and "reminded" him of our conversation and
FINALLY a reg #2692 :) also do a /whois DrDon! hes the one that showed me
kali :)
<P>
Well it was this time that I started to play war2 over the internet. At
first I would only play with about 6 guys that were in my town :) and MAN!!
were those the fastes 6 player games that I have EVER played :) Then
eventually I ventured out into the unknown. I remember only making 1
baracks (cause that is all you need you know ;) also I remeber playing
humans allot. But slowely I was introduced to ORCS :) Usually by an
asskicking. I cannot remember allot of games ever going past the grunt
stage though.. Well.. after many games I slowly switched over to orcs and
began to get allot better!
<P>

<font color=855e42><b>
ii) Intro to IWL
</font></b><P>

This was when I first heard of IWL .. some guys were talking about it on a
seperate channel... so I barged in :) and started asking questions. The
funny thing was, back then, it was kinda a secret so noone was telling
anyone, but these guys offered my a internet ulr :) THEN I joined the
IWL... I remember now that the funny thing was this quotation on the IWL
hompage: "IWL brought to you by the makers of the NWL" hahahahaha you see
the NWL actually came before IWL, but!!!! it was not the same league as you
are probably thinking.. it was NOT the "Newbie Warcraft League" (that you
probably know) but rather the "National Warcraft League" (thus the IWL =
International Warcraft League being the next logical step :) )
<P>
It was funny, because back then noone was playing games (kinda like now;)
and only a few clans had more than 1 member (if even 1!) So why did I sign
up on Blackrock? Well.. I was NOT the first leader of Blackrock....
<P>
It was rather a guy by the name of Tyrsis, a guy that was a member of an
orginization called TIC (the inner circle), which was kinda like the
{{sk's}} (shadow knights). And back then , his named apeared Tyrsis[TIC2].
I played a game and got wased by him and a friend (yes I did have partner
too) they had ogres when I had grunts :( (this was before wallin strat was
around). I kept on questioning Tyrsis after the game about TIC ..(I though
it was some sort of insect;) He was very kind and talked to me about war2
and warchat:) "Warchat" was a program he was writing that would basically
replace kchat for war2players. I think i would of been cool. Anywayz...
warchat didn't happen because Tyrsis's computer crashed and he was
disconnected for awile.. during this time I recieved an email from cplwill
saying "Tyrsis has not replyed to my emails, therefore you are the new
leader of Blacrock" haha its easy to become leader !! :) Back then
Blackrock was ranked dead last (before the 1st reset) and I was the only
member.
<P>
<font color=855e42><b>
iii) My rise to glory.
</b></font><p>

During this time I figured out if I was going to be leader I had better
start getting good :) so I practice and practiced on everyone. I did not
focus on how to "eventually win" but rather how quickly to win :) I became
a good war2 player (not great yet) It was about this time that I burst onto
a channel called #iwl on kchat. There was where I found some of the greats
of war2. Including Shlonglor, who had made a reputation for himself through
his war2 page. It was here where I took my first step as a warior :) I was
just sitting around minding my own business on #iwl with shlongy and some
{{sks}} and some other guy (who was pretty good but I cant remember now),
anywayz this guy challanged me to my first iwl match :) it was some small
level for 2 players whith long land bridges (forgot it :) and it came down
to.. him going for knights waaay to early and me :) going for massive
grunts level 5 :) he was only level 1 or 2 with knights! heh so I won. We
then went back to #iwl and shlongy was still there and when everyone asked
"so who won" , I didn't say anything, but rather forced the other guy to
say "umm Jonny did" well to say the least.. everyone was amazed becaue I
had 0 pts and this guy had a few ... it was only about a minute before a
guy named ChrisM, who at the time had THE highest score on iwl, joined
#iwl. I think I remeber shlonglor asking me something to get my attention
and then provoking ChrisM to challage me. You see, the thing was that when
I won the previous game it was REAL close so shlongy probably knew that
ChrisM would waist me.
<P>

<font color=855e42><b>
iv) The Battle!
</font></b><P>

Well ChrisM ended up challaging "anyone" to a match so I said "ok I will
play you" Everyone kinda laughed ("hehe") because they also knew that I was
no match. We ended up playing GOW on low. *gulp* I knew that these guys
were real good at low, and still no wallin strat yet!! Chrism ended up @
red (5) and I was @aqua (6:30). I actually was soo intimidated by ChrisM
that I ended up launching the first attack. I got kinda lucky and ended up
waling right over to him with 3 grunts (noone knew colors yet either). But
he defended sucsefully and then launched a counter attack with about 6
footmen. I had managed to produce about 5 to kill his six off :) I think
this made ChrisM kinda worry cause he though I was a newbie and an easy
kill. Well this was before the time of long games, and what ended up
happening (to make a long war short :) is we mined just about every damm
mine in the whole map!! The game ended up going for 2 hrs ++ and the center
mines had changed hands 4 times. Me, him , Me, him, then mined out. I was
just about to give up several times, when I was saved by some lucky peon
being able to build a great hall in time. But Chrism still poured out the
knights and basically killed my whole town. :( I really though I was gone,
cause all the mines were gone right? WRONG!!! (remeber I was @ aqua 630)
and I hadn't even mined Purple yet!!! (8:00) haha!!! so I sent an army of
my last peons over to put up a town hall and start mining :) Luckly my
buildings were so eradically placed that ChrisM hadn't stumbled upon the
vital buildings yet (mound, smith, 2 baracks) so I started pumping them out
ogres once again. During this time he had sent most of his forces over to a
mine on the other side of the map (black 10:30) that was already mined out
and contained only a few farms and 1 barack. I secretly started to build up
ogres and hide them just outside of center. Then, after he had totally
killed al the buildings he send the knights (his remaining force) over to
my main town. I then moved my ogres in a postion to flank his knights as
they went to my town. My counter-attack was sucsessfull and I heard a "ohh
shit" :) ruuuhhahaahha! He then realized that it the fat ladie hadn't sang
yet :) and he rounded up EVERYTHING he could find and moved it to his main
town to defend (he also though that all mines were out) I sent everything
over and he defended :( so I made more :) and sent them over and weakened
him. then I only had a few ogres and 0 money when one of his knights
discovered my peon line @ purple :( so I rounded up the 3 and killed his
one knight :) but then he knew he had to leave his town to kill the
remaining hall @ the mine .... I pumped out about 10 guys and split them
into 2 groups of 5, 5 went to mine and 5 went to center for a surprise
attack (so much for making this a short war2 story:) The 5 guys managed to
take all but 2 of his men at the last mine but peons had enough gold to
make 2 more ogres to kill his 2 :) and in the meantime ... the other set of
5 ogres ravaged his town. He spent his remaining gold pumping out futile
efforts to kill the ogres. so ........ I WON :)
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUhahahahhahah!
<P>
Back to chat! We both went back to chat and .. to #iwl and shlongy was
still there allong with allot of others (no life shlongy :) haha ) they
were all anxious to hear who had won because we had been playing for over 2
hrs (which was unheard of at the time) Well then the awnser came........ (I
made him say it :) "Jonny won :( " ruuhahah! then confusion strikes.. "what
who?" "Jonny?" "really?" "how?" "are you kidding?" "wow!!" " you guys Jonny
is really good!!!!! " haha I was luvvvving it :) my head began to swell to
3 times its normal size :) Then to even make it better ChrisM had got a pic
of the stats that remains on shlonglors page until this day :) (about time
for a story ehh? haha!)
<P>
Well from then on I was readily accepted into the untangiable
good-players-list and started to hang out with the greats :) Well time went
by and IWL became more famous. All of the sudden I stared getting email for
people to join my clan (recruiting was a thing of the past) they came to me
now.. Among the people was a guy named FOSS who ended up making THE best
clan homepage in the IWL, and was always comming up with new ideas
including the "shitlist" my favorite, in which he had little midi songs and
a little animated cartoon telling why a certian person was soooo shitty!
FOSS's page was to IWL wat shlonglors page was too WAR2 :)
<P>
<font color=855e42><b>
v) You reap what you soe :)
</b></font><P>

During this time the IWL experienced some tradegies... for it was now that
shlonglors stormwreaver clan had risen to the top of the ladder (this is
when shlongy was in his prime, he was the top guy on the top clan!) But
after shlonglor reached the top, he got tired of the responsibilities and
b.s. that go along with being in a league and made this famous quot... "The
IWL is 0% fun and 100% pain in the ass" haha! I was kinda dissapointed in
shlonglor at this time. One of the reasons that the iwl was having problems
was infrequent updates, because there was no automated system, and CplWill
never realized the amount of workload that it would bring him. One man just
couldn't keep up with all the wins reports, rule making, (and also playing
war2, you see shlonglor discovered that cplwill was actually playing as
zima of the twilight hammers at this time :) So anywayz the IWL died :( and
the like to shlonglors page from the iwl page dissapeared :)
<P>
One thing that I haven't told much people about during this time was the
email that shlonglor sent me during this time: It seemed that Shlonglor was
trying to convince me to quit IWL because it was dead (hindsight is 20/20
haha) but I resented him more for this, he said that him, Azure, and
Marshal (some war2 greats) were going to all quit IWL and start up a new
league. Well I was kinda of concerned about this, and leaked some of this
info to cplwill (sorry shlong :).. and then Shlonglor and Cplwill had about
a 3 replied emails going from one to another saying stuff like.. Q."Why do
you want to quit IWL?" A."Becase its no fun and a pain in the ass" Q. "Well
so your kicking the IWL while its down?" A." Yes, I enjoy kicking things
while their down" So basically, in my eyes, Cpl was just trying his best to
keep the IWL up and running and all shlonglor was doing was complaining
cause it wasn't good enough, but shlonglor was kinda doing this in a
non-serious way, but I dont think that cplwill took it that way........
<P>
So what resulted? Cplwill got real pissed and basically left the same
message on the IWL homepage, about "people following shlonglor like little
lost puppies" and left it there for almost forever....
<P>
One other relevant issue worth talking about, which occured around this
time, was Shlonglor's depression. (hehe) As Shlonglor told us later, one
day he got tired of people writing negitive email to him, when all he was
trying to do was provide the best strategy guide and entertaining war2
stories on the web! People were just emailing him allot of shit. So shlongy
got pissed and decided to basically shut down his page!! (sound familar?)
The only thing he left was a comment saying to email him "if you care about
his page" As much as I wanted to email shlonglor saying "Hey I love you
page, but does this give you some clue to how cplwill might of felt when
you where 'kicking the IWL while it was down' ?" ... haha! ... but rather I
decided to just say "Hey man, I love your page and I really hope you don't
let the neggitive guys get to you too much!" Well shlonglor decided to
bring his page back up about 3 or 4 days later telling us why he shut it
off. The funny thing was that allot of people asked to use his
hard-earned-time-consuming strategy page since he wasn't going to!! I
belive that this pissed shlonglor enough to bring the page back to bitch
out the asses :) BTW, that is why you see all the copywrite stuff on his
page now :) hehe..
<P>
<font color=855e42><b>
vi) The return of IWL
</b></font><P>

Well the next major landmark event that I can remeber was the reincarnation
of the IWL. A guy by the name of RTM took it upon himself to write a
program which automated the iwl and made it possible to handle the loads of
information being poured through the page everyday. RTM did a great job
getting the IWL back up and making it better that it ever was before! Man
did people start racking up points.. I think i got about a million points
off of "Nowhere to run, Nowhere to hide" ruuuuaahaa! Basically the reason I
picked this level to master, was for 2 reasons. #1) Some pepole in the IWL
seemed to have allllot of time on their hands. #2) I didn't have time on my
hands :) ... soooo... basically I looked at all the levels and figured that
Nowhere would be the most time efficient level to master. And boy was I
right! I even remember one day I think I stole about half of ChanmanV's
points during 6 straight games on nowhere, haha! But like everything else,
the IWL started getting allot of loopholes in it. Cirtian levels were too
unfair to play, do to starting positions, or some people would only "accept
challanges" and not issue them. And the Bloodmatch ended up being more
trouble than it was worth. But through it all, my clan and I had managed to
be on top of the ladder once and nearly always withing the first 3
positions. This was the hight of the IWL, it was catching the wave at just
the right time. People where happy that they were earning points, and I was
getting nearly 10 applications to Blackrock per DAY .. this was partly due
to FOSS's page :) I ended up running a very organized and caring clan in
IWL. We had newsletters, secret pages, pornography :) haha!, and lots of
cool music!
<P>
<font color=855e42><b>
vii) Trouble in Paradice
</b></font><P>

BUT THEN...... right when everything was going good.... RTM decided to put
out a questionare.. and one of the questions was " How long should the IWL
go before we reset the points" .. ohhh man was I pissed!! I mean I had
waited it out and belived that IWL would come back after the 1st reset ...
had put up with people telling me that "its nevvvvver comming back" and
gave my clansmen hope.. and now when things were going better than they
EVER had before, RTM was asking for a reset????????????? Ohh man was I
pissed!
<P>
Now, I dont know why or how RTM judged that poll. But I belive that he
might of done it by popular vote. Now let me ask you this! If I have low or
no points, and you have high points, am I going to want us to both have the
same points (or 0pts?)???? YES! and unfortunaltly most people had lower
points and not higher points sooo obvoisly most people would vote for the
reset. Imagine, if you are poor as allot of people are, and there are some
really rich people out there, would you be opposed to distributing the
wealth (damm sociallists :) ? well duh! haha ... anywayz.... enough
politics.. what ended up happening is that RTM just decided it would be
easier for everyone if he reset the points. END OF IWL .... unfourtuantly
what good players that were left from the 1st reset didn't both racking up
many points after the 2nd reset, and who can blame me! umm I mean them!
haha
<P>
So I dont know if IWL will come back during the future, however my personal
belive is that IWL was like a big snowball rolling down a hill in the
middle of winter. And during the 2nd wind of IWL it was a really big snow
ball gaining snow as it rolled, but now the snowball went over some hot
coals and now its small, also its running out of hill to keep it rolling;
and spring is around the corner. Spring being the realease of some new
video game :)
<P>

<font color=855e42><b>
viii) Back where I started !
</b></font><P>

Well what did I do after the IWL? Well mainly I didn't do much. I didn'
even try to look for an IWL game, however I did play one I never reported
points. I was just out of energy to start racking them up again. But what I
really did is go full circle and ended up where I started out. I began to
have fun again! for awhile there were about 8 of us who would meet every
night and play a 8 player pos game :) ohh boy were those fun, it would be
me (Jonny*), shlonglor, {{Nate}}, {{Megatron}}, {{Dragonlord}}, HKUser,
Longsword, and a whole bunch of others that I cannot remember right now :)
anywayz man when you have 3 teammates that are awsome it makes the game soo
much funner. You never have to worry about telling your partner what to do,
cause they already know :) Those games where NOT a battle of who KNEW the
best strategies (cause we all knew em all) but rather a battle of which
ones you used! Well that lasted for awhile but eventually I could no longer
play those early games around 10pm :) haha.. So what did I do after that
for fun?
<P>
<font color=855e42><b>
ix) The return of the King :)
</b></font><P>

RRRRRRRRuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhahahaaaha:) I proceeded to
make not only a name for myself, but turn myself into some sort of legend
:) I went to central and started shaping the minds of new war2 players :) I
would join a game with 2 people already in it (they are waiting for 4) and
tell them that I'll play them both, then watch them laugh and then watch
them be amazed when I win :) haha... In my luckier moments, during the 2 on
1s, both of them would leave their messages on. and I would get to hear
"ohh shit he is attacking me with ogres already!! Help!!" partner replies
"Damm I cann't he's attacking me too right now!" aww this was by far the
biggest head sweller of all :) On very brave days I would venture into a
game an challage some decent guys to a 3 on 1. Now this was no picnic, but
I managed to pull it off a couple of times :) and boy was it worth it ! One
day feeling especially cheery, I came upon a game of gow on high, that was
full w/ 4 players, but I managed to get in. The creator said "sorry Jonny
full game" then I replied "wait! what If I take you all 4 on?" haha now I
was kinda just kidding, but they accepted and though they would make short
work of me! Well they did at first. they totally desroyed my fisrt town but
fortuantly I had a back up going and then a 3rd. I managed to kill 1 right
away, then another, but then got hit bad with a combo ogre and griphen by 2
players and that hurt! But it was no match for the mighty lusted ogres and
lusted axethrowers :) then it was a simple 2 on 1 :) and they were gone :)
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuUUUUUUUUUUUUh
hhhhhhhhhhahahahahahahahahaha!!!!
<P>
Another game I remember I had 1 partner vs 6 of them, they totaly wiped out
my partner at the begining and payed no attention to me. So did I save my
partner? NO !! haha (I kept a couple of peons for him though haha) instead
I built up and hit the opposition at it's source hehe 1 by 1 killing them
all off. Taking out their single cannon tower with a dragon and then
proceeding to lust thier town :) haha town of lust :)
<P>
Well those were my last days as a war2 player, I ended up making a name for
myself and actually being quit feared. I saw people on Central imitating me
:) with names like "MEvsANY2" haha so I would join :) and then they would
say umm nevermind, Jonny can you please leave ? haha. Or just to join a
game and people that I dont know to say "hey Jonny!!" "I remeber you!"
"remember when we played, you killed both of us?" ohh man for awile I felt
like "Norm" on "Cheers" haha; I would come into a game "hey Jonny" or
"Jonny!" or "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrs Jonny!" (my favorite Nate:)

Well I guess thats about all you can hope for, and more, in a game. To be
able to show your superior mental power over your opponet. To insult them
with lusted peons finishing off thier last farm :) or maybe just going into
a war2chatroom and having everyone recognise you as if a big banner popped
up telling them who you were and why they should be nice to you :) But...
also ... to have great friends that share in your agony and rejoyce in your
victories. It dosn't get much better than where I have been and what I have
done with war2. So I guess you could say I'm getting while the getting is
good :)
<P>

I've also saddly noticed that there is an overwhelming population on kali
now, and now its as if the nice little Kali town was turned into a dumpy
Kali city. A city which is poluted with jerks and just plain asses. :( I
would hope that ther would be a reffuge from all the idiots on kali, that
was suppose to be starlink after central, axxis, and castle got too big;
but saddly even starlink is dieing by poluting jerks. I partually blame the
polution on kali95 because all they have to do is click on the kali server
rather having to FIND the server by asking someone. You see, as simple as
that was, it was an easy way to ensure that all the jerks weren't on "our"
server. but alas.. who knows the future?!. . . . . . . . . ... .

IV) What will I do now?
</font></b><P>


Now that I am free from the chains that once binded me to my computer hours
upon hours everyday, I have chosen to invest my time in establishing a
marketing bussiness that I belive will ensure my financial future. Among
other things I love to practice Wing Tsun, a stlye of kung fu, once a week.
I highly recomend, if you have ever been thinking of joining a martial arts
orginization, to check out a Wing Tsun school near you (do a web search). I
also enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, who is as beautiful as any guy
could ever think to ask for. I guess you could basically say that I plan on
experiencing life more! I hope this tragic tale of a war2-kali-addicted guy
named Jonny* has help you to understand why you spend so much time online
and give you hope someday on kicking the habbit! :) hahah I love you all
!!!! However if you are ever playing war2 on kali years from now, and
someone named Jonny* appears on you screen, do be frightened, for he is a
good spirit and he will do his best to aid you in your quest!
<P>

Sincerely,<br>
Jon Williams<P>
Jonny*

Jonny was and is a great guy. He was one of the War 2 greats, a part of the
crew. He was also one of my closest Kali buddies. He will be sorely missed.
But I wish Jonny all the luck in the world. He is doing something that
probably no one has ever been able to do...quit kali and the entire
internet. You know I tried for the summer and after a month, it was
torture, and I had to come back. :)
<p>
Bye Jonny... snif snif :(
