NOT ANOTHER STALEMATE STORY (that's right, it's NOT)
<P>
	At last, I have been part of one of those legenday 8 player epics that go 
down in history.  8 players at the start that is, I don't think a REAL 8 
player game has yet happened...
	I joined what looked like an ordinary open game that vitor was starting on 
castle, and for some reason loads of other people joined.  The slots just 
filled up, hardly any drops, it was weird.  The map was High Seas, Medium 
resources, and the layout was this:<P><pre>
	RED		JEFFDACE
	BLUE		Me
	AQUA		Vitor
	PURPLE		Riva
	ORANGE		Demonlord
	BLACK		Sputnik
	WHITE		Coldblood
	YELLOW		Elminster</pre><p>
	We were all really surprised at the beginning when no one dropped straight 
away.  The screen was full of messages saying "wow!  8 players!  no-one 
dropped!" etc.  It was fairly playable too, slow, but hey - 8 players! 
 Anyway, as soon as the town halls finished and everyone started on their 
first farm it broke and both red and white dropped.  This was good news for 
me cos it meant I could sapper through to red's spot and get his mine quite 
easily :).  The game speeded up a bit after that and it was quite ok.
	I decided to go for the early transport full of grunts strategy, so I 
built up my town, quite quicky, and got about 3 grunts into a transport and 
sent it up to aqua (vitor) right above me.  Unfortunately he had 3 footmen 
ready, which finished upgrading to level 2 halfway through the fight, so my 
guys got wasted :(.  I sent a few more in, and got a jugg ready too, but 
the early grunts tactic had failed, so I concentrated on development 
instead.  Meanwhile Vitor was complaining that 5 people were attacking him, 
hahaha.<p>
	At this point I hit a problem... having built a transport and a jugg as 
soon as possible, I had no oil to upgrade my hall, AAARGH!  This slowed me 
down quite badly cos I had only just started my oil platform.  While this 
was going on, Vitor got some guys into my town and hassled me a bit, killed 
a few peons, but I fended him off without too much trouble.  I got a couple 
of catapaults out and sent them up to the top of my area... vitor had built 
about 8 farms in a block below his mine, so I set my cats to blowing them 
up, and getting rid of the archers he was hassling my flyer with.  My first 
ogres had to stop another of his anti-peon raids, no problem there.  While 
I wasn't looking, he got my cats with some of his own, but I replaced them 
and carried on razing :).<P>
	Vitor mentioned that he was being attacked again, and then next time I 
looked up to his base, there was nothing there except some puple knights! 
 Riva brought down a few mages as well, and was happily cleaning up vitor's 
stuff, so I sent in a few fat boys and took them from behind, muahahahaha. 
 Vitor said thanks for saving my last 3 farms and 1 peon, so I assumed he 
was well out of it (BIG mistake...see later).<P>
	Just after I got a fortress, my mine ran out, and (BASTARD!) I hit the 
unit limit.  This really is a major bummer:  even if people drop I think 
the limit is still what it was set to at the start of the game, which isn't 
much for 8 players.  It took ages to sapper through the rock to red's spot, 
cos my sappers kept being cancelled by the limit (AFTER they've taken all 
that time to build).  I was running out of wood too, blue has hardly any on 
that map, and when I got through the first thing I had to do was build a 
lumber mill and get some wood in, before eventually I set up a new hall... 
JEFFDACE had build his hall MILES away from the mine, I don't know what he 
was playing at.  Sometime about then Sputnik and Demonlord both dropped 
too.  I'm not sure if Riva killed Demonlord first or not, but Sputnik had 
loads and loads of stuff in his base, he had started on white's mine too.
	<P>
	So, at this point: aqua was dead (I thought), purple was doing well, had 2 
mines, I was in a fairly messy situation with the unit limit cropping up a 
lot even though I never had more than about 8 ogres at that time (it was 
all my peons I think...I had maybe 30-35), but I got my altar and temple up 
and had everything upgraded, and some juggs defending my bay.  I hadn't 
seen anything of yellow so far, but just then I saw him: he had build his 
foundry across the river so that his peon came out on red's side.  He sent 
his peon down towards the mine, probably feeling quite clever and pleased 
with himself, hahaharrrr, when he saw my hall with 20 or so peons buzzing 
around it :)).<P>
	I killed that peon with 2 of mine, and started building towers next to the 
mine.  I grabbed about 4 spare grunts I had standing around and sent them 
over to protect, and sure enough a yellow transport turned up, but only 
with maybe 3 ogres and 2 axemen!  Plus he landed them in such a position 
that only 1 at a time could fight my 4 level 5 grunts, hardehar!  Even 
better, the transport then got stuck in the river and couldn't move.
	<p>
	Just after the first 2 guard towers were ready he sent one dragon along to 
attack them.  Mad.  I don't know Elminster, but I think he must be quite 
new.  He build a shipyard in the river too... why??  Eventually I put up a 
cannon tower, and that and a little death and decay took out the lot, and 
one of his cannon towers.  He had a ring of cannon towers around his coast, 
until I sent 4 juggs in and creamed them.  He managed to get 1 of my juggs 
with another dragon, but by that time it had followed them all the way back 
to my base where it got deathcoiled in 3 seconds ;).  At 2500 a piece, if 
you're not going to cast haste and bloodlust on them, or even attack in 
groups, WHY BOTHER building dragons??  I sent a load of ogres in and did 
some damage, and one of the others finished him off later I think.
<P>
	Anyway: although I was coping with yellow without difficulty, I was in a 
shitty situation.  I had loads of money and wood, but I couldn't build any 
more stuff because of the unit limit.  About then I sent a flyer over 
white's old base, and what did I find?  Why a teaming little aqua-coloured 
town with barracks and everything.  The dead had risen from the grave! 
 Vitor didn't bother pretending to be gone any more after that.
	Meanwhile the shit had hit the fan.  Riva got together a big group of 
stuff, knights, dragons, mages and sappers, and hit my main town.  I had 
only 6-8 ogres and a few death knights there, that was all I could build. 
 Some cleverly cast death and decay bought me some time, but I couldn't 
stop him from building a barracks at the top of my town.  Slowly and surely 
my town got wiped out and I considered myself gone.  I sent my last ogres 
up to riva's base in a transport and they killed a bunch of stuff, couple 
of mages, but didn't last too long.
	<p>
	I could have left then, but I had so much money and wood left which I 
hadn't been able to use before that I thought what the hell, I'll start 
building a new city and see how long it takes him to destroy it.  So I 
upgraded my town hall in red's spot, already had a barracks there, and 
started building away.  Pretty soon, as my final farms were disappearing 
back in the old town, I realised I had enough resources to rebuild an 
entire city, all the necessary buildings, and a load of troops as well!  No 
need to worry about the limit either.
	<p>
	I stuck some peons in the hole I had made earlier in the rock, so I would 
have some warning when the rush came, and managed to get altogether about 
10 ogres, 4 death knights, 4 dragons and 5 juggs before my cash ran out. 
 He sent in a few knights, managed to exorcise one of my dks, but didn't do 
any real damage.  At that point I was coming to the end of my cash flow, so 
I said "let's see if I can spend all my money before Riva finishes me off". 
 He replied "What with?  I'm done"....!!!!!!!!  WHAT?  I couldn't believe 
this, so I sent a flyer over his base, and lo and behold it was full of 
aqua knights.  Vitor was just wiping him out.  When I checked out Vitor's 
base there was hardly anything in it, but he had 2 transports and some 
mages, and barracks of course and shipyard & foundry.  I don't know whether 
it was Riva or Vitor who had finished off Elminster, but he was gone by 
this time.
	<p>
	Rubbing my hands together with glee I bloodlusted up my dragons and sent 
them up to get rid of those transports.  Narrowly avoiding several 
blizzards, they did this and returned home, a little weaker.  I asked vitor 
if he had any more or could make them, but soon I saw one pop out of the 
shipyard.  Off went the dragons again and destroyed it.  Unfortunately my 
juggs got killed in a fight with Riva before so I had no ships at all and 
no money to build them.  I had 2 zepps left, which Vitor kept hassling with 
archers and fireballs, but I always managed to keep one near his shipyard 
to watch for transports.
	<p>
	The next one filled up with sappers, eek!  I put the dragons just offshore 
to wait for it, cos they're not fast enough to get it on the way, and had 
peons round my coastline and 3 deathknights waiting.  As soon as the 
transport came near, I set the dragons on it, then cast death and decay all 
along the bit of coast it was heading for.  If it had only landed it would 
have been dead for sure, and the sappers too, but he turned it round and it 
got away with a little health left and went for another stretch of coast. 
 Hmm, no mana left to d&d with...  Desperately I got a bunch of ogres ready 
to strike when it landed, but just as it did the dragons hit and took it 
out, sappers and all.
	<p>
	YESSSSSSSSSSSS!<p>
	This was getting tense.  I sent my drags up after the next transport, but 
all but 1 got blizzarded/shot, and then he put out a destroyer, oh no.  The 
destroyer somehow managed to get both my zepps and my dragon, and then I 
was in the crap.  Riva was still around with a couple of flyers, and he had 
been chatting away about seeing if it would be stalemate (Vitor claimed he 
was broke, so he can't have had many more transports coming) and around 
then he said something about wanting to see the "30 sappers" in Vitor's 
base get into my city...   Oh fuck!
	<p>
	Well with no air recon available, or sea attack, I was more or less done 
for, but I hung around a little while to see when the attack would come, 
but it didn't really.  Vitor pissed around landing knights in my old spot 
and trying to clear a path through my peons, presumably so he could land 
all those sappers there and run them in before I killed them.  I saw some 
of his gryphons sitting around, and he had plenty of knights about the 
place too, so he could have just attacked: I figured I wasn't going to stay 
around just so he could have some fun with his sappers when he had the 
forces  to finish me straight away, so I left in the end.  Just shows how 
important it is to finish people off properly.  Hell of a game, must have 
been at least 2 hours.  One day I will be in an 8 player that actually 
lasts the whole game...one day...<p>

Hope you like it...<br>
