Who doesn't love Nintendo's pink mascot, Kirby? Only those with souls dead to cuteness. As I've played more and more games in the Kirby series, they continue to grow on me. I'm especially fond of the 3DS releases -- they're not difficult games, but just an enjoyable escapist diversion with great art and music.

Somehow (I assume the kids asked for it) I downloaded _Kirby Super Clash_, the newest entry in the franchise on the Switch console. From what I can tell, it's a re-imagining of _Team Kirby Clash Deluxe_, which was a free-to-play 3DS title. The premise of this game is four Kirbys taking on RPG roles and fighting various boss characters. Beating the bosses nets you loot, which you spend to upgrade gear. Get better gear to take down harder bosses. Defeat harder bosses to gain more experience points. Repeat ad nauseum.

The game design is not original in the slightest, but I'll be darned if it still isn't pretty fun. Bear in mind, however, this is coming from a person who has sunk more hours into the Diablo series than I'd care to admit.
