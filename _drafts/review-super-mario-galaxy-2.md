<p>1. Summary of SMG1<br />
    a. Great game, lots of content, more linear (read: focused) than Mario Sunshine<br />
2. Intro to SMG2<br />
    a. Read more about it at Iwata Asks<br />
    b. Uses the same game engine, but totally new content<br />
3. The Game<br />
    a. Streamlines the entire Mario experience - no "hub" level, just move to a level and go<br />
    b. Not much "filler" content - each level is unique, even "comet" levels that make you re-do a star in a more challenging way are different and unique enough to make it feel new<br />
    c. Basically the new pinnacle of the "Mario" genre</p>
