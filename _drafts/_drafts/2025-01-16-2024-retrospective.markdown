Hey, it's 2025! Time once again for my yearly blog update, wherein I try to rack my brain to remember whatever the hell happened to me last year. I'll try to recount chronologically, but some events may shift due to the weakness of my aged brain.

Probably the first really notable thing that happened in 2024 was my grandmother celebrating her 100th birthday in February. My mom organized a large celebration in conjunction with their local church, and even made provisions to stream it so that out-of-towners such as myself could virtually attend. It was pretty cool hearing grandma talk about different events in her life; 100 years is a long time! The transistor wasn't even invented until 1947, and now runs our entire world.

Shortly after, I got my first running injury of the year while grinding out a long run on a treadmill: anterior tibial tendonitis. No idea what caused it, but instead of stopping the run when my foot started to hurt, I kept going &mdash; and then had to stop running for two months. Galaxy brain level thought process right there. I had registered for the Flying Pig marathon in Cincinnati, but had to give up that idea since I missed such a large part of the training block.

I needed some sort of change after that, so cut my hair that I'd been growing out for the previous two years. It was down to my shoulders and was getting somewhat annoying to take care of, as I washing it almost every day due to copious amounts of sweating during exercise. I sent the remains off to Locks of Love, which I had also done about 20 years ago after my first stint of long hair growth.

We didn't travel a whole lot this year; about the only place we went out of state was down to Panama City Beach during spring break in March. We'd been there a few times before, so no real surprises, but always good to be on the beach. I was just starting to get back into running after my injury, so was able to do a few short runs along the beach, which is enjoyable for me. 

The highlight of April was definitely the solar eclipse that passed over much of the US. As opposed to the one in 2017, we didn't have to travel quite as far to view the totality &mdash; it passed over western Ohio, just touching my sister's house near Dayton. It was perfect weather for viewing &mdash; we didn't have to all pile into vehicles and make a mad dash to escape cloud cover this time. This one might be the last total eclipse that I see... the next that touches the continental US isn't for another 20 years, and will only be visible in Montana and the Dakotas. Who knows what'll happen by the time I'm 63?

In June, we finally pulled the trigger on a kitchen remodel after living in our place for 15 years. The house was post-WWII construction, and had the original kitchen cabinetry. It was just old and gross and in need of a refresh. We'd held off making any changes because we weren't sure if we wanted to expand the house, and include updating the kitchen with that work. In the end, however, the quotes we got for making the whole house larger were more than we wanted to pay, so settled on something with a smaller scope. I think it turned out really well; we got help from a local interior designer who got us into her network of suppliers, and handled a lot of the logistical elements. There is probably about 2x cabinet space now, and the contractor removed the layers upon layers of vinyl flooring (which I grew to hate) and laid down hardwood that matches the rest of our house. It's definitely the improvement that has boosted quality of life the most for us so far.

I stayed in the same job for the entire year, which is good, I guess? One cool thing was that in October they moved their offices from a bland building in New Albany to the Short North. I can actually ride my bike to work again! 

We stayed in Ohio for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year; I didn't feel up to driving for hours and hours. My parents came out for Thanksgiving, so still got to see them for a bit. Lots of time at the in-laws during Christmas, which was also nice.

I ended the year with various "challenges": I joined my friend Sam in doing a weight loss challenge, as I had gained a decent amount after taking a break from running. When you stop burning 1000 calories/day exercising, it's easy to pack on a few pounds. It worked pretty well, as I'm lighter now than I have been in years. My other challenge is finishing work on the 2nd bathroom in our basement. I have been slowly plugging away at it, but was stymied for a while with tiling the floor/walls. I decided to set at least one tile per day, and as long as I keep at it will _eventually_ finish. The insane thing is that our family has been living with only one bathroom.

Looking ahead, I have a few goals for 2025. It'd be great if I could recover from my running overtraining and get back to the fitness level I was at last year. The bad thing is that I'm not sure I really have a lot of direct control over this, aside from taking it easy. I'm also giving myself a moratorium on buying retro games until I write reviews for my existing collection. In some measure, I've started collecting more because I am able to play less, which is a messed up situation. I'd also like to try to finish a few of the projects that I've gotten 80% done and then abandoned &mdash; this is of course easier said than done. The big goal for 2025, however, is figuring out a 3rd bedroom situation. The twins are outgrowing their shared space, and even though it's not 100% necessary, it'd be great to give them their own rooms. Since expanding the house is cost-prohibitive, my current DIY ideas are to either split the basement in half and install an egress window, or else put dormers in the garage attic.
