Another year, another marathon retrospective! I started training this year using the lowest milage plan from 
[Advanced Marathoning](https://archive.org/details/advancedmarathon0000pfit_n3u7) by Pete Pfitzinger and Scott Douglas. It had slightly more milage
overall than the "advanced" plan from Hal Higdon, whose plans I'd followed exclusively up until now. It was pretty enjoyable, and the only deviations I 
made were due to catching COVID (!) about a month and a half before the race. Really, that was the only hiccup in my training, as you might expect.
My kids came down with it from school, and it spread rapidly through the house. I never tested positive, but was down for the count with a high fever
and lethargy, so not sure what else it could have been. I missed about a week of training, including one of my scheduled 20 mile runs, unfortunately. 
Getting back into easy running was concerning, as my heart rate (as reported by the optical sensor on my watch) was 20-30 bpm higher than normal. I 
ended up staying conservative in my return to training, as well as buying a chest strap HR sensor for more accurate readings. It took two weeks for 
me to get back to "normal," but didn't miss any other long runs, so felt I had a reasonable chance of still being able to race.

I thought I was relatively safe from sickness after that, but two weeks prior to the race, my twins came down with colds. Vigorous hand washing saved 
me from infection, thankfully. Then, the week before the race, my oldest daughter came back from a school-organized overnight camp with a stomach bug. 
My wife proceeded to get sick the day before the race, and my youngest daughter the day of. I was up at 4AM on race day cleaning up barf. Amazingly,
I was still unscathed, aside from running (ha!) on terrible sleep.

Otherwise, race day was mostly uneventful. Traffic to the starting area was terrible, as usual. I made it out of the parking garage with about a half 
hour to spare, and thought I'd take my own advice from last year and use a porta-potty, but the lines were so long and slow that I didn't have time. 
There were signs advertising “restrooms are in the starting corrals!” But that was a lie. So I just held it for three hours! I didn't even really
have enough time for a proper warm up &mdash; I was still fiddling with the fit of my shoes when the starting gun went off.

My race was not very strategic — I mainly went by “feel”, even though I was wearing my HR chest strap. I didn’t do enough training at race pace 
to have a good sense of how fast I could/should go. I was definitely running faster than most of my training runs, and I was breathing hard, but 
the pace felt sustainable. Fortunately my target pace (7:15/mi) was conservative enough such that my endurance was sufficient. I tried 
to pair up with other runners who were also trying to hold a similar pace, and ran for a few miles with another guy around my age, but ended up 
dropping him even before the halfway point. The rest of the race was a solo effort.

One last-minute change to my plan was bringing along my own gel packets. I watched a video of [Floris Gierman's](https://www.youtube.com/c/FlorisGierman) 
Chicago Marathon experience, and noted that he brought quite a few gels. I felt like I would definitely need them, as there are only 
two nutrition stations along the Columbus course, but I didn't know how to carry them. On my long runs during training, I would usually only 
bring two gels, which fit neatly into a side pocket on my water flask. Well, I ended up just shoving them in my pockets &mdash; I ate one in my car 
before the start, then put one in each pocket of my shorts, and carried a third. The additional weight in my shorts ended up not being that big of 
an annoyance, even though I'd never done it before, so I'll probably adopt that strategy again in the future. In total I consumed five gels; four 
of my own, and one from a course nutrition station. My one regret was that I didn't take the last gel packet; I was having a hard time getting them 
down by that point in the race and didn't think I could choke it down. The volunteer handing out the flavor I wanted was offering two, and I 
thought "no way I can eat those!" so just skipped. I think if I would have taken 15 seconds to eat that last gel, I would have done better for the
last few miles.

Even after experiencing cramps in the last mile last year, I never really investigated ways to replenish electrolytes during the race. Of course
the same thing happened this year. One amusing thing was being encouraged by another runner during the last stretch to the finish. My hamstrings 
were on the verge of seizing up; "I can't push it too hard, I'm cramping up!" I told him. "So am I!" he yelled as he passed me, then continued to
yell "Ow! Damn!" as he kept on going.

On the whole, I was pretty satisfied with this year's race. My official time was 3:12:54, more than 5 minutes faster than last year. Even with 
catching COVID, I felt a lot stronger, especially just after finishing &mdash; last year I was barely able to hobble to my car; this year I was 
even able to walk the dog with my family later in the day. I still have the goal of a sub-3:00 race though, so there'll definitely be more running 
adventures in my future.
