I think the thing I miss the most about my iPhone is the fact that it was _from the future_. If my high school-aged self had a chance to look forward in time and see the computer hardware his future self was using, he probably wouldn’t have been that impressed. Sure, computers now have faster processors and more RAM, but we’ve been on an upward trajectory for years now… Moore’s Law, and all that. The iPhone is like a convergence of _awesome_… my past self would have been amazed at all the functionality of the device, which you used your darn fingers to interface with. Sadly, the phone I have now, even though it was released recently, reflects some 2004-vintage tech. Un-inspiring.
