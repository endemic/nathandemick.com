OK, I know I’m reaching here… but I submitted Revolve Ball in the “Games” category, with one of the subcategories as “Racing” (well, you are trying to beat the clock… it’s more racing than puzzle). So a screenshot of the game was under the iPad “New & Noteworthy” in the “Racing” category. Kinda cool =]
