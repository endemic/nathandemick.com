> GOP Cookies at Mozarts

s0u1man: for the record, I wanted to buy a donkey cookie  
s0u1man: but they were out  
butr0s: haha  
s0u1man: and when we asked the girl if we could buy elephant cookies, but count them as donkeys, she looked at us with this condescending look and said “do you really want me to?”  
s0u1man: so then I shat on her face  
butr0s: hahaha  
butr0s: I just lol’d  
s0u1man: ok, that last part was made up  
s0u1man: but the first part is true  
butr0s: no, no, don’t tell me that  
butr0s: it ruins the illusion
