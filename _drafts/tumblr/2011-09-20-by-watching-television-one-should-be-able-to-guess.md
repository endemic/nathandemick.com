title: By watching television one should be able to guess that no matter how old you
  get, the same bullshit is always waiting to haunt you… but for whatever reason I
  reasoned that problems, no matter how complex, are in someway bound and finite.
  And in that reasoning, I came to the subconscience conclusion that if I work all
  of the existing ones out, I could actually live in peace… Sadly, this assumption
  was clearly wrong.
