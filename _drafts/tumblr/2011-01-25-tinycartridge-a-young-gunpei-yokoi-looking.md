> A young Gunpei Yokoi, looking like a straight-up ladies man with his Wonderbread pocket square.
> 
> Almost every photo you’ll find of the Game Boy creator will show him [dressed for work](http://tinycartridge.com/post/49782020/gunpeipercraft) and with a bit of gray in his hair, but this photo scanned from [Pix’N Love’s French biography](http://editionspixnlove.fr/collectiondetail.php?ID=49)&nbsp;shows Yokoi as a young and cool fellow — one who hadn’t yet suffered the scorn of Nintendo’s former president Hiroshi Yamauchi after choosing the wrong kind of LCD displays for the company’s 8-bit handheld.
> 
> This looks more like the Yokoi briefly alluded to in Osamu Inoue’s book _Nintendo Magic_: “Yokoi had a reputation as something of a playboy — he’d done ballroom dance in college, played music, drove around in foreign cars, and spent his summers diving.”
