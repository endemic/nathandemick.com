title: Sure, it [Android] comes with a whole host of freedoms that I can exercise,
  like installing a third-party keyboard component to replace the system keyboard,
  but I didn’t exercise those freedoms because I don’t care, I’m just not that guy.
  I never themed my Windows installations, never jailbroke my iPhone, never turbocharged
  my car. I want a phoneputer that just works and lets me pursue my own goals; goals
  that don’t include being a sysadmin.
