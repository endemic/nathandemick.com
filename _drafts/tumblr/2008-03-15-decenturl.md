[DecentURL](http://decenturl.com/)  

I remembered this site (and went searching for it) while reading Bruce Schnier’s monthly [Cryptogram newsletter](http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram.html "Cryptogram newsletter"). He was using [tinyurl.com](http://tinyurl.com/ "tinyurl.com"), and although his practice was better than most (using the shortened URL after the long one, in case the long one got broken by the email client), it still reminded me of the ambiguity of shortened URLs. If you have the choice, use an URL shortener that gives others a better idea of what they’re clicking.
