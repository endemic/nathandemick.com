> Happy Mother’s Day!
> 
> I often portray my mom as a timid lady, because she is so loving and sweet.&nbsp; But she’s tough too, she tried very hard to give us every opportunity in a small place, without much.&nbsp; My mother is the one who has believed in my abilities the longest, and the fiercest, and for that I owe her everything.
> 
> In this particular exchange, she also showed me that people’s talent may not always be what it appears to be to others, and that we all may have a greatness in us that not everyone can see.
> 
> Remember to call your mother today.&nbsp; She loves you.

Cannot “like” this enough.
