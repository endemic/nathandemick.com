<p>We all know that Cave Story (Doukutsu Monogatari) is an awesome game. When you learn that it took 5 years for Daisuke "Pixel" Ayama to finish the darn thing, it seems a bit shocking. However, when you consider he did everything himself (art, music, design, programming) himself, and take into consideration the quality of the game, that number doesn't seem too unreasonable. Would you consider that development time frame "excessive?" The man is a legend now; not on the level of Shigeru Miyamoto or Hideo Kojima, but definitely up there.</p>
<p>Cave Story is the first exposure most people probably have had to Pixel's work</p>
