I just bought (well, pre-ordered actually) the <a href="http://minibosses.com/merchorder.htm">new Minibosses CD</a>. $12 shipped, not too bad.
<p>Wait, wait, WAIT! I was just cursing material posessions after helping some friends move... why am I getting more junk? 
<p>Eh, I guess one CD isn't gonna break the camel's back...
<p>Also, happy birthday to me ol' pater. He hits the half-century mark, and I'm almost at the fourth.
