<p>Zomg, it's an "art" tutorial! Faced with the need for buttons for a game UI, I wanted to create something low rez and pixel-y. Doing a search for "pixel buttons" didn't really turn up a whole lot, so I kinda mucked around and came up with something I liked, which was an amalgamation of various sources of inspiration. Now I'm regurgitating this process back onto the 'net, so hopefully it'll be useful to you as well.<br />
<a href="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/button-steps.png"><img src="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/button-steps-234x300.png" alt="" title="button-steps" width="234" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-262" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Determine size you need, then halve that. Create a new image with the halved size, but add an extra pixel to both width and height. So, say I want a 200x40 button, I'll create a 101x21 new image.</li>
<li>Draw a border along the edge of the image, but leave a pixel's width of spacing on the bottom and right of the image. We'll use that spacing for a drop shadow.</li>
<li>Determine how rounded you want the button to be. <a href="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/button-border-radius.png">See some examples</a>, and modify the corners of your button appropriately.</li>
<li>Select the color you want for the button, then fill the whole center with that. </li>
<li>Lighten your color slightly and outline the top and left sides.</li>
<li>Darken your color slightly and outline the bottom and right sides.</li>
<li>Create a new layer, then add a black border in the extra space on the bottom and right sides. Lower the opacity of the layer to 25%, then merge it with the main button layer.</li>
<li>Scale the button by 2x, using the "nearest neighbor" scaling algorithm.</li>
<li>Add your text with whatever text decoration you like.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
