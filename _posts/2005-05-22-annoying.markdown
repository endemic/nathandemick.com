My telnet sessions time out after about one minute of inactivity. I'm not sure if this is because of my worthless port-blocking router or not. I tried the UPnP (or whatever it's called) option which is supposed to automatically forward ports, but it doesn't work. I tried giving myself a static IP and manually forwarding ports, but that didn't work either. In any case, nothing is more annoying than hitting a programming problem, finding the answer, then returning to the terminal, only to discover that it's not responding. Lame!
