One of the problems with being a technophile is the rapid pace at which new technology is
released. It seems that every other day I see something drool-worthy that would
make my life immeasurably better, if only I could cram it into my house alongside
my other troves of junk. I try to resist these base urges, but don't always
succeed. A few weeks ago I was tempted by Google's Black Friday sale, and ended
up purchasing a new 32GB Nexus 5X for $350 (the same price I paid for a 16GB Nexus 4,
three years ago), and figured I'd provide my thoughts regarding one of Google's newest
reference devices.

When reading other reviews before my purchase, I was worried about the "feel" of
the phone. It's made out of plastic, and one reviewer at The Verge mentioned that
it felt cheap and "hollow." Personally, I didn't experience the same reaction --
the phone feels fine to me. It _is_ made out of plastic, which I was worried
about. The phones that I've used the most in previous years (iPhone 4/5) have
been primarily constructed of glass/metal, which are heavy and feel nice. The
Nexus 5X is surprisingly light (as you might expect) for being a 5"+ phone,
but the matte plastic finish on the back is actually pleasing. To be honest, I
think that plastic is a decent tradeoff for a phone these days, even though
"premium" phones have metal bodies. The problems with the metal enclosure are
weight, as well as the fact that metal interferes with wireless reception. What
Apple (and other manufacturers) have done is to make cutouts in the back of the
phone. The iPhone 5 had a decent-looking solution for this, which was to use
glass panels at the top and bottom of the phone's back. The glass panels obviously
didn't match at all with the aluminum enclosure, but it looked pretty good. The
iPhone 6 family eschews the glass cutouts for plastic lines around the back
of the phone, and they look terrible. To be honest, I prefer the solid plastic
back of the Nexus -- at least it's a uniform.

The other area where I prefer the design of the Nexus 5X is its camera bump.
I guess we've reached a point these days where the demands of high-performance
camera lenses and thin enclosures mean that camera lenses protrude from the
back of our phones. The iPhone 6 has a little nub, which asymmetrically juts
out from the upper right side of the phone. The Nexus 5X puts the camera in
the center of the body, and the plastic back smoothly rises up around it to create a
pleasing beveled effect. Seriously, if you're going to have the camera extend
from the phone's back, at least [embrace it](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9418245/smartphone-camera-bumps-are-in-style),
as opposed to making it look like [an embarrassing afterthought](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6209759/apple-has-an-embarassing-bulge).

My last phone was an iPhone 5, so I've never used Touch ID. For that reason,
I can't really compare it to Google's version, which they call Nexus Imprint.
The position of the fingerprint reader on the Nexus 5X is OK -- yes, you have
to pick the phone up in order to use it, but one of the things I like about
Android phones is the software buttons, so the sensor had to go somewhere else.
The sensor will both turn on _and_ unlock the phone, as opposed to the power
button (which shows the lock screen), so it's nice to have that choice (I use
the lock screen for media controls). I will say that once you have a phone with
biometric security, it would be hard to go back -- it's obviously super convenient.
It's pretty egregious that Apple has had a lock on this tech for the last two
years, but I guess that's what you get when you [buy the company](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/01/26/nexus-6-fingerprint-authentec/).

USB Type-C. I like it. It's the future for sure. Reversible connectors are so much
better it's not even funny. But for now, it's kind of a pain -- you'll have to
buy some new cables or adapters. I wanted to do some remote debugging, and was annoyed to
remember that I needed to physically connect the phone, and didn't have a
Type-A to Type-C cable. One good thing about the iPhone's ubiquity is
that everyone has a Lightening adapter. You can forget your charger at home
and it's not too big of a deal. If you don't bring a USB-C cable for your Nexus,
you're outta luck.

As far as the rest of the package, the software is Google. I find that I use
Google services a lot more these days, and they have the added advantage of
a web-based presence. For example, I can upload a book to Play Books from my
computer, start reading, then download the book/pick up where I left off on
my phone. I really like the Google Now launcher, which to be honest is still
probably the best part of Android phones. There are a few games that don't have
Android ports (Kero Blaster, for example), but I can live without those. I like
how Android/Chrome makes web apps more like first-class citizens. In general,
the software Just Works.

I have until the end of January to decide whether or not I want to keep the
Nexus, but as of right now I'm thinking I'll stick with it. It does enough of
the things I care about well enough for me to be satisfied. At least until I
see the next iPhone revision.
