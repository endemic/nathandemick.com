So although I do complain about globalism, I still like the idea that Squaresoft 
has of re-releasing their popular games with "International" tacked on at the 
end of the title. "International" in this case means the games' dialogue is in 
English (with subtitles of course), and there are a few added goodies which make 
the game worth playing again. This means that an "international" title is much 
more playable for me: since the voice acting is in English, I can follow along 
with the story a bit better. Of course, the rest of the game uses Japanese text, 
so I get some educational value out of it. I felt like a winner because I read 
through the blitzball instructions in Japanese. However, today, when I was 
trying to turn the Aeon animations off, I noticed an option to turn the entire 
game into English.

You have no idea the temptation that provides.

After reading a foreign language for any significant period of time, your 
brain starts to hurt. When I see English again, I sometimes feel a palpable 
sense of relief. So, I want to play the game in English, but I must hold out! 
I will learn more Japanese! It's a totally useless skill, but we don't talk 
about that!

My new words today:

* 家事 [kaji] - household chores
* 禁欲主義 [kinyokushugi] - asceticism

(These next ones I didn't learn today, but they're from my MGS3 vocab)

* 麻酔銃 [masuijuu] - tranquilizer gun
* 任務 [ninmu] - duty, mission
* 潜入 [sennyuu] - sneaking, infiltration

Can you feel the worthlessness?
