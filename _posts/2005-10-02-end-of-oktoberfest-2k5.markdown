Well, it's Sunday night, and another year's Oktoberfest draws to a close. No one died this year, although Stavros did go in for the big spit a few times last night. Suprisingly, today he showed no ill effects from his excessive consumption. This afternoon a large group of people went to Schmidt's Sausage Haus in German Village, and everyone had a meat headache afterwards. <p>
Even though I haven't worked for around 1.5 months, I kinda don't want to go back to <a href="http://www.griptechnology.com">work</a> tomorrow.  Must be human nature; although I know that I'll be insanely bored with no job, I still don't like having one sometimes.
