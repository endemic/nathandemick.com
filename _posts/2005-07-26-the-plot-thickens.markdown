Hmm, so in case any of you didn't know, apparently Matt H. is coming to Japan next week, <i>to take over my teaching position</i>. Yeah, kind of unexpected, but I guess he really wants to be back in Japan. Also, note the mad competency of my school: not hiring another teacher until a week AFTER I leave. Oh well, I won't be around to feel the effects. More news as it breaks...
