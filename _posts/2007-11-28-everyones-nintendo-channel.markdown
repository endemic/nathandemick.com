<p>So, I guess the "<a title="Minna no Nintendo Chyanneru" href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/features/minnano_nintendo_ch/index.html">Minna no Nintendo Channeru</a>" launched in Japan today. It looks interesting, and I can't wait for it here, but really the only compelling feature is the DS downloads. I figured I might as well translate the page for the heck of it.</p>
