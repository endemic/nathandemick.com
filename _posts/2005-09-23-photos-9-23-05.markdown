<a href="./images/random/the_collection.jpg">My vidgame collection, boxed and ready to go</a>. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff. You can't even see about half of it, because those big plastic containers are stacked. Suffice to say, I possess a lot of videogame history. I need to sell a lot of that junk. I think I can probably get rid of the Saturn if I buy a few of the Sega Ages games. The only Saturn games I own that are worth playing are NiGHTS and Panzer Dragoon. I also want to get rid of my Playstation, but who would want it? I'll probably have to imagine a creative way to use the case; make a flower pot out of it or something. By the way, I'm going to make all you Funlumbus people play Katamari Damacy and Minna Daisuki Katamari Damacy. Consider youreselves warned.

Here's the <a href="./images/random/beach_group_shot.jpg">men's group photo</a> at Holden Beach. In the back we got Greg, Ed, Phil, Alan, Jake, and Andy. The front is, of course, me, Soulman, and Patrick. The first five guys in the back row are going to be my roommates in a few days.
