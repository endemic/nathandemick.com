<p>I kinda quit reading Penny Arcade regularly a while ago... the comics were just too hit or miss for a while; I really didn't like the fact that I had to read a blog entry to understand what was, in essence, a gaming industry "political" cartoon. I think that their level of influence over their audience is also a bit disproportionate, but that's just my own bitterness speaking.</p>
<p>Regardless, a while ago they teamed up with a development studio called Hothead Games (an aside: they're doing some interesting stuff... you'll no doubt hear more about them in the future) to produce their own episode-based game series. I hear good things about the first entry, which is encouraging. However, what's really interesting is the digital distribution service that is going to make the game available. In essence, they're rolling their own online game store. That, in itself, is not interesting. But the fact that they will help distribute indie-developed games is. Being featured on this service seems like a sure-fire way to (at least initial) financial success as an indie. The qualifier being that only "Tycho and Gabe approved" games will make it.</p>
