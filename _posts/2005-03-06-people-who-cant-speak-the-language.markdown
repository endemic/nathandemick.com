    communicate with pen and paper.

    just draw what you want to happen.
    like if you go to the store and want to know where the pr0n is just draw a little business man wanking off and the clerk will either direct you to the pr0n or beat your ass.
    on second thought maybe you shouldn't communicate with pen and paper.

<p>I've slowly been getting over my annoyance at being a foreigner; mind you, it's still there, but perhaps diminishing over time. Possibly part of this is the fact that my Japanese has gotten a bit better. I now know what the traffic lights say, and can understand a few of the routine phrases store clerks spout at me.</p>
<p>One thing that's been bugging me recently, however, is people who don't know Japanese, and make absolutely no effort to learn. Obviously, you can get by without knowing the language; some things might be a bit difficult, but you can brazen it out. In fact, knowing a bit of the language is more work: you have to really struggle to communicate, whereas if you know nothing, you can simply ignore everyone around you.</p>
<p>Wow, it's actually really difficult for me to put my feelings for this topic into words. In any case, I can easily sympathize with immigrants to the States: it's ridiculous hard to learn a new language, especially when you don't have a teacher, and ESPECIALLY when you have to work full time. It hasn't really stopped me from trying, but then again I have kinda stopped progressing recently.</p>
