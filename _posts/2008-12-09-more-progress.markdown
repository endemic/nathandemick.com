<p>What with Thanksgiving and having to teach my Bible study last week, I haven't had a whole lot of time for programming recently. Couple that with the fact that I'm psuedo-sick again, and it's hard times for Actionscript. I needed some inspiration this past weekend, which I got in the form of browsing around some <a title="Ifinite Ammo" href="http://www.infiniteammo.ca">stuff</a> the indie community is doing. Also, by firing up my <a title="Aquaria" href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/">Aquaria</a> demo (which I never finished).</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/files/Game-120708.swf">most recent build</a>. I got some simple "alien" type guys moving around in there, and am experimenting with a background. I'd like to try making the background move in relation to the ship, but I'm not sure how the effect will turn out. Guess we'll see!</p>
