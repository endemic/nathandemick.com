Since Nate made this as a test post and I can edit it I will turn this into the part where I suggest music to download (and, in effect, screw over the RIAA. HA!) And since I have the ability to edit my posts I will just edit this one every time I get something new and worthy of a download.<br>

I found it today and it's everything by FSOL including A LIMITED EDITION RIP OF ISDN WITH NEW SONGS!!#$!%*@%&%@%@ Not to mention all their singles and whatnot. Get it.<p>
Coldplay - X and Y<br>
Fiona Apple - Extraordinary Machine<br>
Chevelle - This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)<br>
Outkast - Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (no really, this album is just so damn good)<br>
Massive Attack - Protection<br>
Massive Attack - Mezzanine<p>
I'd toss the new Gorillaz album on there but... it's just... not... good. There's like two or three songs I like on that whole album. I blame DJ Dangermouse taking the place of Dan the Automator.<br>
But anyway, here:<br>
Gorillaz - O Green World<br>
Gorillaz - Feel Good Inc.<br>
Gorillaz - November Has Come (feat. MF Doom)<br>
Gorillaz - Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head (just because it's got Dennis Hopper in it)
