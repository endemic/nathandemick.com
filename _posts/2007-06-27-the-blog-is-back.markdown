<p>Yollah to the people who still check this page!</p>
<p>I busted out the old WordPress database, upgraded it, and here we are! The previous posts are vintage, aged about two years, from back when I was wallowing in Japan. It makes light, interesting reading, and is especially nostalgic for me. Like a dog to its' vomit, I keep coming back for more blog action. If we can learn anything from history, a prediction that I will get tired and delete everything here wouldn't be too far off the mark. However, until that time, you can read sporadic ramblings that emanate from my ridiculous head.</p>
<p>I'm mostly going to be writing about videogames, running, and perhaps Christianity, since those are the biggest things in my life right now (aside from the girlfriend, but she's not a topic for the intar-nets). If you want to hear me opine on something, drop me a line and I'll write up an essay.</p>
