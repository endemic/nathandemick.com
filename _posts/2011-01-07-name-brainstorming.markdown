<p>I came across this file the other day, back when I was trying to figure out a name for my new game. I thought it was interesting, so figured I'd post it here. Basically what I did was make a list of words that described the core ideas of my game, then use a thesaurus to get some synonyms. Then I tried just randomly combining words until I hit on a combination that I liked. Not very scientific, but I really like the result. You can see how I immediately stopped after I found the one I settled on =]</p>
