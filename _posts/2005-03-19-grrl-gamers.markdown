<p>In a random stint of surfing the web, I happend to run across a site called <a href="http://www.fragdolls.com/">FragDolls</a>. After a hearty laugh, I attempted to discover the exact purpose for such a site. Notice, if you will, the coy illustrations throughout the site, coupled alongside copious pictures of the girls themselves. The entire page seems like a giant advertisement... but for what?</p>
<p>I then noticed that the group is sponsored by UbiSoft, a software publishing company. Coincidentally, many of these girls like to play games published by UbiSoft! I never would have guessed.</p>
<p>Really, this topic in and of itself doesn't make for a very interesting entry. I'm just rather bitter about the entire presentation of that site, so I figured I'd rag on it a bit.</p>
