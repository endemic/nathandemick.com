  content: HEY!  I want to watch "Zatoichi" again!  Did you buy the DVD?  Also, why
    would interaction with a stranger make one want to kill oneself?  I think I'm
    missing something crucial here.

  content: 'Yeah, I bought the DVD... it''s a two disc set, with another Beat Takeshi
    movie that I''ve never seen. I really like that movie, but none of the people
    I watched it with seemed to like it very much. Fucking Philistines. Also: yes,
    I got the scarf. I''ll have someone take a picture of me wearing it, then send
    said picture to you.'

  content: 'About the interaction with strangers: the other night we were driving
    to Steak ''n Shake, waiting for a car to pull out of a parking spot, when some
    jackass kid zooms in ahead of us. We thought he was going to take the spot we
    were waiting for, so Kelly jammed on the horn for a long time. Turns out the car
    was just trying to park on the side of the road. As we were walking by, the driver,
    some skinny hipster smoking a cigarette, looks over and says to us, "You got a
    fucking problem?" Soulman responds with "No, do you?" and we leave it at that.
    However, I had a very <i>real, irrational</i> urge to go over and rip the kid
    apart. Mebbe due to other stress or whatever, but I had to stop myself from going
    over and getting in his face. '

  content: Glad to hear you didn't 'get in his face'.  I've definitely had the urge
    on several occasions.  Luckily for me, the times I have actually done that nothing's
    ever happened to me.

Yeah....
<p>
Going to watch 'Zatoichi' tonight, which I first saw with my sister in Exeter. Maybe there'll be a lot of people coming over... maybe too many. I will subject them all to Japanese cinema! Next time it's going to be Battle Royale, which I am *cough* acquiring as we speak. Perhaps some Kurosawa after that.
<p>One o' these days coming up I'm gonna organize a group of people to go <a href="http://downtowncolumbus.com/holiday/skate_on_state.php">Skate on State</a>. Lame name, but should be good times. Ah, yeah, I worked on that page, which is how I know about it. 
<p>I had a brilliant idea this morning, which was, instead of buying an expensive chest of drawers, to make a homemade version that would consist of MDF and milk cartons. I have a Lowe's gift card, so the MDF was basically free, and the milk cartons were, uh, also free. Ghetto furniture!
<p>On the way to Lowe's, I pulled up to a stoplight, and heard some familiar music coming from the car next to me. In fact, it was 'Amsterdam' by Guster, off their CD Keep It Together, which I have recently started listening to. Yes, it's stupid: they're one of my favorite groups, and I hadn't really listened to a CD they released two years ago. So I said, mostly to myself, "Hey, it's Guster!" which the driver in the neighboring car heard. So I gave her a thumbs up. It was one of those weird moments when interaction with total strangers doesn't make one want to kill oneself. Unlike last night, when I had to resist the urge to smash a kid's windshield with his face.
