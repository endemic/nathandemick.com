  content: "That's Chinese, yo >_<\r\n<p>\r\nWhy didn't he make it cross-platform?
    That worthless sack. I'm sure as heck not buying a PSP, and I don't have a darn
    Windows machine. Not until I get back to the States, anyway."

  content: "Well, I can't tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese because
    I don't have any of that crap installed.<br>\r\nIt just comes up as a bunch of
    ??????'s<br>\r\nAnd can't you do anything with the source code? I figured you
    could...\r\nNooch."

  content: dude he probably single platformed it cause you called him japanese.  i
    hear them and the chinese don't like each other.  he probably feels insulted.

  content: 'I''m looking at the source now, but it might be futile. Right now it looks
    like he wrote some kind of animation library on his own... technically, since
    it''s OpenGL, it should work crossplatform, but... here''s a secret... I''m a
    BAD programmer. This web page, the simple programs I make cause I''m bored? NOTHING
    compared with a project like this. '
- author: Nate
  content: So, the deal is that OpenGL commands are the same for every platform, but
    opening an OpenGL window and processing keyboard input is different, unless you
    use a multiplatform library like SDL. He's using Windows crap, from what I can
    see, and like I said, this project looks too intimidating for me to even start
    picking it apart.

While this isn't much of an article I felt that it needed front page attention.<p>
Some crazy <strike>Japanese</strike> <b>CHINESE</b> computer science student has made a pc port of Lumines.<p>

<a href="http://acm.tongji.edu.cn/people/kaikai/down/lumines.rar">win32 version of the game</a><br>
<a href="http://acm.tongji.edu.cn/people/kaikai/down/ogl2dlib-2005-5-28-lumines-single.rar">game source code</a><p>
I'm currently playing it and I don't foresee myself stopping until I have to go to work.
