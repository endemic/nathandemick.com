<p><a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~johnlau/nasir.html" title="The secret behind 'Programmed by NASIR'">The secret behind 'Programmed by NASIR'</a>. I remember seeing that name (in the original Final Fantasy) and wondering if it was just a nickname (it seems that sometimes a developer will have a non-Japanese sounding nickname in the game credits) or a team of people. Turns out it's just one guy, who did some work on some cool games and then vanished. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Gebelli" title="Check out the Wikipedia article on Nasir Gebelli">Check out the Wikipedia article on Nasir Gebelli</a> for even more info on his past work.</p>
