Finally getting around to making note of this here: I finished another simple
puzzle game a few weeks ago. It's a _hashi wo kakero_ implementation, called
"Let's Build Bridges." [Check it out on the Ganbaru Games site.](http://ganbarugames.com/bridges/)
It works great on mobile (Chrome/Safari) as well, so you can save it to your
device's homescreen for fast access. Alternately, I put an [IAP-enabled version
on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lets-build-bridges-japanese/id1020197906?mt=8),
so plz give me pennies.

Also, since trashing the Ganbaru Games dev blog, I needed something to put
there, so ended up making a [faux smartphone-type interface](http://ganbarugames.com).
It's a bit spartan now, but will be fleshed out a bit as I slowly convert some
of my Javascript games over to using [Arcadia](https://github.com/endemic/arcadia).
