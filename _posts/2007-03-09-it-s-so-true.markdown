Aight, I'ma get all religious on yo' faces. I had an experience the other night that exemplified a biblical proverb. 

<div class="quote">
As a ring of gold in a swine's snout, so is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.<br />
Proverbs 11:22

I went with some friends to a bar/restaurant on Monday, mainly for the $1 grilled cheese sandwiches. As we were being seated, I noticed that the waitress was really attractive... I mean <em>really</em> attractive. I felt kinda unsettled, however, because she looked vaguely familiar. It wasn't until I heard someone say her name that it hit me: this same waitress used to work at an Italian restaurant downtown when I was at my old company. She would sometimes come into my office, I guess because she had a thing for one of the guys I worked with. Of course, since it was a big sleazefest in said office, I heard various things about her that were uncomplimentary to her character; plus it was a huge mark against her just to be voluntarily associating with these guys in the first place. <br /><br />
Anyway, once all this flashed through my mind, she didn't look so hot anymore. <br /><br />
Just another thing to keep in mind: beauty (and lack thereof) is more than skin deep.
