<p>In searching for resources to re-work this site's design, I came across a number of well-known (and not so well-known) sites which host various interesting things.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jttk.zaq.ne.jp/babwp701/hpfont/font.html" title="Tons of fonts from various Famicom and arcade games">Tons of fonts from various Famicom and arcade games</a>. Compiled by a guy named Genshichi Yasui. I found it via browsing <a href="http://www.zone38.net/font/" title="codeman38's font collection">codeman38's font collection</a>, which has lots of great fonts, including ones based off Secret of Mana and Donkey Kong Country.</p>
<p>If you've searched for "video game maps" before, you've no doubt come across <a href="http://ian-albert.com/misc/gamemaps.php" title="Ian Albert's Video Game Maps">Ian Albert's Video Game Maps</a>. Comprehensive maps from various classic (read: good) games. I need to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget" title="wget">wget</a> his site sometime.</p>
