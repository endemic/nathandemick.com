The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated. I'm back in good ol' Hastings, Nebraska, hanging out with the folks. The trip back was fairly average: I couldn't sleep at all, and basically sat in a trance because my contorted body was too cramped to move. Plus, I almost drained the battery of my iPod in one go. I went from Hikone to Tokyo to St. Paul to Detroit to Omaha, which in total spanned about 20 hours. Plus, I didn't get mugged and have all my money stolen! Hardcore, eh?
<p>
So far it's been pretty good to be back in N. America; hard to believe that I was gone for a year. Also, got to see off Matt before he hit Utsunomiya to take my place. Today I totally ate some great food, and I will eat more great food tomorrow.<p>
Hah, as an aside: Sam and I bought a Nintendo 64 on Monday, and we totally played a bunch of Mario Kart 64. It was excellent.
