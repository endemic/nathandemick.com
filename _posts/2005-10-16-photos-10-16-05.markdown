Here's some from this weekend:<p>

Our neighbors had a party. This is the destruction that resulted:

<li><a href="images/ohio/backyard_before_2.jpg">Before (POV2)</a>
<br>
After Ed, Patrick and I cleaned up:

<p>
<a href="images/ohio/red_ed.jpg">Ed</a>, Beth, and <a href="images/ohio/stuff_on_my_face.jpg">I</a> went to a 'face party' on Saturday. No masks allowed.<p>
After looking at today's date, I'm reminded of where I was a year ago at this point, which invevitably leads to a comparision with my current situation. Wow. I've got it, like, eight million times better here.
