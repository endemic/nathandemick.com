Over time, I've slowly become a bit of a keyboard nerd. When I put together my very first PC as a teenager, I ended up buying an [IBM Model M keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard) from a
friend's dad. At the time, I didn't know that it would eventually rise to legendary status among keyboard enthusiasts &mdash; I just knew I liked the heft
and the satisfying sound of the keys being pressed. That Model M stayed with me for years and years, but fell into disuse. For a decent chunk of my 
professional life, I used Apple's modern chiclet-style keyboards; at the time, I liked the short key travel and the extra space separating the keys. Eventually
I started working from home more often, and so needed to have two setups for my laptop. At the office, I used quieter keyboards, but at home I dug
the Model M back out. I found someone on eBay who sold me a cable that converted the PS/2 output into USB, suitable for use by a modern computer. And I started
to really enjoy using the old clunker. When you type on a keyboard all day, it turns out that the type of keyboard makes a big difference (see what I did there?).

When I switched jobs in 2015, I decided that I needed a better keyboard "for the office." From various parts of the internet, I had heard about the [Happy Hacking 
Keyboard](https://hhkeyboard.us/), and was intrigued by the 60% size and Topre keyswitches. I bought one, loved it, and have been using it off and on ever since.
With that experience in mind, when I switched jobs last year I thought I would continue the "new job == new keyboard" tradition, and built a custom split keyboard
from [Keebio](https://keeb.io/), the [Quefrency](https://keeb.io/collections/split-keyboards/products/quefrency-rev-4-65-split-staggered-keyboard). I wasn't sure
what to expect, having never built my own keyboard before, but the hotswap keyswitch sockets made it incredibly easy to put together. No soldering was required;
it was basically about the easiest possible way to get into the DIY keyboard hobby.

Well, I haven't switched jobs again, but I recently got the itch to build _another_ keyboard. I was trolling the internets, as one does, and saw pictures of
vintage Apple Extended Keyboards hacked down to 60% size. My interest was immediately piqued. My keyboard collection at this point included boards with
buckling spring switches, Topre switches, and Cherry switches. I had been wanting to make a board that used [ALPS style switches](https://keyboardsexpert.com/what-are-alps-switches/),
but hadn't been able to find suitable keycaps. Unfortunately, most enthusiasts these days use Cherry-compatible key switches, and therefore most custom keycap
sets are for Cherry switches only. ALPS switches have a different stem shape, and are incompatible.
