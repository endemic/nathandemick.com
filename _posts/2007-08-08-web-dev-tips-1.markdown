<p>If you've ever had to do "print" stylesheets, I'm sure it's been exasperating. I mean, seriously... who prints web pages (Aside from people in my office, who print <em>everything</em>)? I saw a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/554-little-css-print-stylesheet-tip" title="post on 37signals' blog">post on 37signals' blog</a> regarding print stylesheets that inspired me. That link isn't actually the original article, but the gist is similar: set <code>display: none</code> for each extraneous element. Easy!</p>
<p>These guys also inspired me with <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/414-home-and-end-two-of-the-most-useful-yet-underrated-keys-on-the-keyboard" title="Home and End keys">another little bit of labor-saving information</a>: the 'Home' and 'End' keys. In your browser, Home takes you to the top of a page, while End goes all the way to the bottom. Amazing how often I use these keys now, in addition to the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' for scrolling through pages. Plus, in your (non-Emacs) text editor, Home moves the cursor to the start of a line, while End goes to... you guessed it... the end of a line.</p>
