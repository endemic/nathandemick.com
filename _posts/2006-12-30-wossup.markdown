I'm all sick and whatnot. I was sick before I went back to Nebraska for Christmas, and got sick AGAIN when I returned. Whadda crock. I would probably feel OK, except for the fact that my nose exploded a few times today, the first two of which were in shopping-style areas. I had to make my purchase extremely quickly, then get out before I bled all over myself.

In alternate news, I found my cache of backup CDs back in Nebraska, dating back to around 2000. Old school! One of the discs also has content from my original form of data backup: namely, Zip 100 disks. On there are such things as my first evar webpage, plus random junk I collected when the Internet  still had that 'zomg' factor. My idea is to take all this digital junk, categorize it, and slap it all up on the web as kind of a virtual exhibition, if you'll pardon the cheesy expression. I'm not sure who will be interested aside from my close friends, but I think it would be moderately interesting to see 10 years worth of junk from anybody. The page'll probably be hosted on nathandemick.com, so I'll post a link when things get moving. They probably won't get moving very fast, though. (as you can see, comments still aren't working here... yea, I'm lazy... and sick... back off!)
