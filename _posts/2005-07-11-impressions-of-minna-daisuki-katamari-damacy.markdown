So I bought Minna Daisuki Katamary Damacy the other day, but to be honest I haven't really played it much yet. I really wanted to get into the 2-player cooperative mode, but unfortunately I don't know how! Anyway, here's the deal: they expand the game more than I thought would be possible. Here are some examples:

* You wander around a map area, and talk to different people. Each person has a problem or something, and then you help them out by rolling up a bunch of junk. There's one person who wants to see a new kind of flower, or the mom whose kid's room is all messy. Et cetera, et cetera.
* Some cool new ideas and areas have been added. There's a stage where you roll underwater, which is basically a zero-gravity style of gameplay. Or, there's a stage where you roll stuff up into this big ball of fire in order to light a campfire. If you go for too long without rolling up any items, the fire goes out, which causes you to lose.
* The game is still whacked out, and has some weird humor, which I can understand in spite of my horrible Japanese. The annoying thing is that the King speaks all in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana>katakana</a>, which is annoying to read. It would be the equivalent to someone writing English only using capital letters, and without spaces. Of course for a native speaker there's no problem, but for my dumb head it becomes rather difficult. In addition, the game will automatically scroll text bubbles after a (short) period of time, which means that after I read the first line of a sentence, a new one appears.
* Other minor details seem to include a revamping of the two-player vs. mode. Now if you hit the opposing player with a dash attack, it knocks all sorts of stuff off his katamari, which means that the vs. mode is actually competitive. In the first, whoever got even a small advantage in the first few minutes would win the round, because he could then roll up his opponent, and the opponent could do a whole lot of nothing about it.

Maybe if I get motivation, I'll play the durn game a bit more and write a full-fledged review. Or something.
