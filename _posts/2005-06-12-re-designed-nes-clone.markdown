    third-party titles will be available for download.

Random intar-net surfing brought me to a company called <a href=http://www.playmessiah.com/index2.htm>Messiah Entertainment</a>, the soon-to-be purveyors of the <a href=http://www.playmessiah.com/onlinestore/index.htm>Generation NEX</a> console. This bad boy is a slimmed-down NES which also accepts Famicom cartridges, and also has support for wireless controllers. All retailing for a mere $60. <p>
To me, one of the real selling points of this beast is the inclusion of Famicom support. A while back, one of my friends brought a Famicom back to the States, and had an unfortunate suprise when he tried to hook it up. It seems that the original Famicom requires a specific video cable that is unique to old-school Japanese TVs. There may be ways around this, I couldn't find one in the brief research I did. The upshot was that we couldn't play the Famicom, and shed bitter tears. Since many original NES units break easily, and the official Nindendo redesign is expensive/hard to find, this knock off might be a worthwhile investment.
<p>
However, I wonder if it's worth the money. Obviously Nintendo has stated that their new console will be able to download old NES/SNES/N64 games, so you can play your old favorites without doing the infamous "system switcheroo" that I'm so fond of. I think the conclusion is that if you have a large collection of (uncommon) NES carts, or want to play Famicom games, put in a pre-order.
