  content: maybe it's like how some words are in english like.........cow and bovine
    or movie and film.  both are refering to a "cow" but are two different terms for
    the same thing.

I'm sure you're all familiar with the traditional Japanese pastime of offing 
yourself. The history of suicide in Japan is long and glorious, but before these 
new-fangled trains to throw yourself in front of came along, people used to cut 
their guts out with knives. Pleasant, I'm sure. In any case, I knew of two words 
for this procedure: harakiri and seppuku. Why two different words? Which one is 
correct? MY BRAIN IS GOING TO EXPLODE!

After some cursory research (read: none), I discovered this tidbit.

* 切腹 => seppuku
* 腹切 => harakiri

The kanji are the exact same, but the order/pronunciation is different. 
Both literally mean "cutting your stomach." That doesn't help me figure out 
which is more correct, but it's a pretty morbid way to start your day.
