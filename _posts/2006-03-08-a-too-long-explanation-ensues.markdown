So, as I'm sure one or two of you know, Final Fantasy XII is being released in Japan in a few days. As a tie in with this, Japanese beverage manufacturer Suntory started making a Final Fantasy-themed 'Potion' drink, complete with fancy-pants limited edition bottles and whatnot. 
<br><br>
I came across <a href="http://kusofla.com/vip/po/">this page</a> that had pictures of Japanese kids mixing their 'potions' with various other drinks/substances. One of the mixers was Smirnoff Ice. The result? <a href="http://kusofla.com/vip/po/img/04.jpg">A Hi-potion</a>.
<br><br>
<div style="font-size:9px">In Japan, adding alcohol to a drink will make it "high." I.E., Chu-hi, which is a fruity alcoholic drink. In the game, a hi-potion is a more powerful curative than the regular potion. Get it?<br><br>
That took way too long to explain.</div>
