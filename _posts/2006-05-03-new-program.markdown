Ugh, once again I realize that I don't have the time/dedication to keep this a 'gaming' page. Oh well!<br /><br />
Check out a program I wrote when I should have been working: <a href="/php/ajax/ajax_test.php">The Engrish Generator</a>. This program takes your input, translates it to Spanish, then translates it back into English. I guess it's not true 'Engrish' since it's not translating to Japanese, but whatever. If I get bored I might add an option to change the language it translates to/from. The other purpose of this program was to (finally) do some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">Ajax</a>, which is how the page can load new data without a visible refresh. Web 2.0, y'all!<br /><br />
<!--
People are starting to throw around the term 'Web 2.0' at work, now, which annoys me to no end, since they don't know what it means. Web 2.0 means making websites work more like desktop applications through the use of technologies like Ajax. Everything is much more seamless; less like the 'Click-new page-click-new page' idea of the web. Pretty much all of <a href="http://www.google.com">Google's</a> stuff is Web 2.0 (<a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> and <a href="http://www.gmail.com">GMail</a> spring to mind). Tell all your friends.-->
