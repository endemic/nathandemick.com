    wouldn''t be suprised if they hit the $200 sweet spot: 1/2 and 1/3 the price of
    the high-end Xbox 360 and PS3, respectively. Definite purchase.'

Ok, 'Wii' is still kind of a lame name for a Nintendo console, but I think that it's going to be so cool that no one will care by the end of E3. First, we have the 'Wii-mote,' which looks amazing (I got a gander at Nintendo's keynote, which featured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoru_Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a>, and <a href="http://www.reveries.com/reverb/kids_marketing/fils-aime/">Reggie Fils-Amie</a> flailing about playing a tennis game). 
<br /><br />
Next, the regular Wii controller is, more or less, a SNES controller with two analog sticks. Since the SNES controller is one of the best ever designed (in terms of tactability and button layout), this looks promising. 
<br /><br />
Finally, there's a new <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/e3-2006-wii-peripherals-and-handson-gameplay-impressions-172941.php?server=46&id=144190329&secret=27564bea16">Zapper</a>,  with the promise of a Duck Hunt sequel. 
<br /><br />
Oh wait, what about the <a href="http://www.gamersreports.com/media/561/">Virtual Console</a>, which, in addition to old Nintendo games, will also allow you to play Sega and NEC (Turbo Grafix-16) games?
