    that video. ;_;

  content: I remember you sent me a link to the site, but I don't remember much about
    it. I think what happened was that the page navigation was too pretentious, and
    I didn't feel like trying to wade through crap to look at the content.

Well, in the spirit of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_to_Daddy>Come To Daddy</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowlicker>Windowlicker</a>, director <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cunningham>Chris Cunningham</a> has released a new "video installation" which means it's Aphex Twin video time.<br>
It's basically the 6 minute story of a boy/man-thing that is kept in a dark room with a freaked out chihuahua by his verbally abusive father, of whom you only see his arm at most.<br>
Anyway, Johnny has to find ways to amuse himself, I mean, anyone would if they were in his situation. However, for Johnny, this involves shape-shifting, spazzing, doing what seems to be a huge line of cocaine (???), and basically playing imaginary laser tag with his deformed chihuahua. Oh yeah, it's also all filmed in nite-visionâ„¢.<br>
This video is set to the Aphex Twin song AFX237 v7 from his album <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drukqs>Druqks</a> which came out in 2001.<br>
Now, I remember having a video I got off the <a href="http://www.druqks.net">Druqks</a> website back when Druqks was first released. It featured a clip from the video of Rubber Johnny sitting in a wheel chair with his grotesquely malformed head and some creepy organ music. Now, that means this video is about 4 years old.<br>
4 YEARS.<br>
... ... did I mention 4 years? For a SIX MINUTE VIDEO? I'm willing to bet that he wasn't working on it the whole time but I mean, he must have had something done back then... why not release it? I mean, I really like Chris Cunningham's stuff but I get the feeling that he's either really pretentious or very very worried about what people think of his stuff. This is also apparent if you bought his DVD that was missing a ton of his old videos and also featured an extremely edited version of one of his first shorts titled Flex.<br>
If you're at all interested in seeing it you can go to the <a href=http://www.rubberjohnny.tv>Rubber Johnny</a> site and check out a preview of the video. If you want a link to a torrent, you know how to get a hold of me.<p>
