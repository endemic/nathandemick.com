  content: "rrrr.<br>\r\nanyway, I beat Katamari Damacy about a week ago and I was
    going to write a review but I really suck at writing reviews. All I could really
    think of was \"Yeah, I played it a lot and then I beat it. I like the music. Rolling
    stuff into a ball is sweet. Did I mention I liked the music, because the music
    is awesome.\"<br>\r\nAnyway, if you want I can track down the torrent for the
    Katamari Damacy OST. I can't stop listening to You Are Smart and the Katamari
    Damacy opening theme, Katamari On The Rock.<p>\r\nAlso, try and beat my score
    of 621m 18cm  :)"

  content: 'Ok, I have no idea how I did that. I played again, and it said I could
    choose "eternal" mode because I made such a big katamari. Obviously no time limit.
    So I collected everything on the map, and it was only like 823m. Maybe I didn''t
    run into as much stuff? Because you lose junk off your katamari if you hit objects
    that are too big. '

  content: eternal mode?!!?! MUST PLAY MORE KATAMRI DAMACY.

I saw a "greatest hits" copy of <a href="http://katamaridamacy.jp/contents_e.html">Katamari</a> <a href="http://wigu.com/overcompensating/2005/05/big-damacy.html">Damacy</a> last week, and finally went and bought it today. So far I'm lovin' it; great concept and awesome soundtrack. I wanted this game for a while, but similarly to Guilty Gear XX #reload, I just couldn't find a copy. I'll write a review later. This is one of those games that just brings a smile to your face while playing.
