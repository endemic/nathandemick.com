<p>Hey web developers, check this out. I've been using IE8 recently to do cross-browser testing, and have been using the "compatibility mode" to simulate IE7. Well apparently you can lock IE8 into running a specific mode by using the developer tools (Tools &gt; Developer Tools). Kinda nice if you want to focus on a particular browser, but then again you have to remember which one you're using.<br />
