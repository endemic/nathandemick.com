Probably going to buy Everybody Loves Katamari Damacy during my "lunch break," which is like from 3:00-4:00. Fortunately today's work load is fairly light, but I still can't wait for the weekend. Then I will play games and waste time in general.<p>
So, like the advantage of CSS is that you can format multiple pages the same way, or change styles very easily, by separating style info from a webpage. Go me, just finally got around to learning it. Anyway, I didn't realize how powerful it is... you can literally put text anywhere, obscure images, whatever. <a href=test_index.php>Here's an example</a> of a retro-themed index. Notice that the underlying HTML is the same, but the style sheet (<a href=classic.css>classic.css</a>) changes a whole lot of stuff. So, if you feel bored this weekend, you can make a theme for this site. Check out a <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp>CSS Tutorial</a> which is pretty good. And, that is it.
