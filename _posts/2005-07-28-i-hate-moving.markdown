So I'm packing up to move on the 1st of August, and it's making me rather depressed. I washed every single piece of clothing I had laying around my room and stuffed into the dresser and all this shit, and I'm thinking "Jesus, I have waaaaaaaay too many clothes. Something has to be done about this." <br> <br>

But then I pack them up, and they fit into two apple boxes. I just stood in disbelief for a few moments, then went back to packing and cleaning. How sad when nearly everything we own fits so neatly into a few little boxes. <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v287/sQuareh4t3r/smiley/3023f590.gif" alt="Image hosted by Photobucket.com">
