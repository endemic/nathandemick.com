Pink Floyd is reuniting for a Live8 concert.<br>
I don't know what Live8 but from the Pink Floyd site (<a href="http://www.pinkfloyd.co.uk" target="new">pinkfloyd.co.uk</a>) I'm guessing it's like LiveAid or something.<br>
Anyway, whatever it is, it's powerful enough to get Roger Waters back with the original crew.<p>
If I've ever needed to find a bag of money just sitting on the street, now is that time.
