<p>Most people know that you can drag tabs out into their own separate window in Safari. But did you also know you can combine them again? Yep, just make sure that the tab bar is set to always be displayed (Shift + Command + T) and then you can drag tabs from one window to another easily. If a window only has one tab, it'll disappear when you move the tab to the second window. Jawesome!</p>
<p>(Also, Command + Click opens links in a new tab. When I had a scroll wheel mouse, I used the wheel click to open/close new tabs, but since I'm Magic Mousing it up, I've had to drop that habit.)</p>
