  content: You needed comments, and so I decided to do the comments work.  Man, I
    love that rap game haha.  And I have been actively writing in my LJ with angsty
    posts, its hideous!  But people tell me I should update, so I give them juice.

<p><a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/wonews/apr05/0405napola.html">A cool article about the Apollo 13 mission</a>. I'm still amazed by this story, and how much effort many highly trained engineers put forth in order to save the lives of three astronauts. It's really too bad that NASA sucks now, because the old space program seems really exciting; obviously it would be even more so for the people of the 70's.</p>
