Did I ever mention that I hate American moble phone companies? In Japan, I got a good plan for $35/month, plus an awesome phone for $50. This was also on a 6-month contract, so I didn't get screwed when I left. Here in the States, I get violated by contracts all the time, and the only decent phone that my carrier offers is the stupidly trendy (and <i>old</i>) <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=razr&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&sa=N&tab=wi">Motorola RAZR</a>, which'll set you back 150 bones. The base billing plan also gives you absolutely nothign in terms of minutes. So last night I bit the bullet and changed my phone plan to one that gives me a reasonable amount of talk time, and got the RAZR to replace the crap clamshell I got for free when I signed up.
