<p>Bleh, a rather crap week at work kept me from updating. Yesterday I began cleaning my apartment in prepartation for <a href="http://www.nativespeakerguy.com">Brendan</a>'s imminent arrival. He's gonna crash at my place for about a week, until the teacher he's replacing moves out. It'll be, uh, interesting having two people in my ridiculous small apartment.</p>

<a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/more_japan/more_omiyage.jpg">Cookies I got from a student</a></p>
<p>I've been doing a bit of the ol' programming recently. I'm going to finish that rock/paper/scissors game, make it a bit nicer, etc. I'm experimenting with using cookies to hold information. I dunno, all the ways of storing user information that I think of seem pretty insecure, but I guess it isn't that critical in this project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/php/cookie_test.php">Here's my cookie test page</a></p>
<p>I also have a great idea for my next project. I want to make a user-submitted database of those small,  80x35 (or whatever) icons that you used to see all over the net. For example, the most popular were problably the ones advocating a particular browser, however, there were lots of <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/random/diesel_power.gif">other designs</a>. So basically this would allow people to upload these images into a kind of repository, just because they're kind of cool, and a historic part of the net. Then you could vote for image popularity, and whatnot. Uhh, I dunno, it seemed much cooler before I wrote it down.</p>
<p>Yesterday I started downloading episodes of Iron Chef. I got a better BitTorrent client called <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a>, which doesn't time out on my bad connection. Of course, downloads are still slow (I'm behind a router, and I can't access it to open/forward the necessary BitTorrent ports), but I can at least get stuff slowly. I loves me my Iron Chef.</p>
