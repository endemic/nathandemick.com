<p>So I just realized that Safari 2 doesn't allow text input tags to be styled. What the heck, eh? I was confused for a while, since I had been using the Safari 3 beta on Windows, and it worked there. Then I get the Mac and <em>nothing works</em> to style those stupid tags. With Apple's "oh yeah, standards, we got 'em haha suck it IE" attitude, I can't believe they would leave this in. Standardization of user interface elements aside, all the other browsers do this, so it's about darn time. My recourse is to say "Sorry!" to the Safari 2 folks. I simply can't do anything about how crappy forms will look to you.</p>
