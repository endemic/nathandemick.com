Last week I finished teaching my class at the local SDF (Self Defense Forces) base. I was always curious as to exactly what they were saying when they saluted each other. It sounded to me just like they were hissing. They'd salute and go "HSSSSSSS!" all the time. Weird, eh? <p>
So, I asked one of the other teachers. He said they are saying "Otsukaresama desu," which means something like "good work" or "you've been working hard." BUT, obviously, they're cutting out most of the phrase, and leave only the hissing "S" sound at the end. <p>I thought it was kinda interesting.
