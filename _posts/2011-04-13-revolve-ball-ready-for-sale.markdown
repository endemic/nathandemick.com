<p><a href="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/enlarged-icon.png"><img src="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/enlarged-icon.png" alt="Revolve Ball App Icon" title="Revolve Ball App Icon" width="177" height="178" class="alignright size-full wp-image-320" /></a>Check-a check it out! The game I've been working on for a while, Revolve Ball, has been approved by Apple and is available for general purchase on the App Store. I think that the game mechanic and controls are pretty fun, it's got 40 levels, and is only $0.99! Basically there's no reason <strong>not</strong> to buy it. </p>
<p>Check out the <a href="/revolve-ball/" title="Revolve Ball splash page">splash page</a> I made for the game, or <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/revolve-ball/id409351780?mt=8">go directly to iTunes</a> to start playing! Be sure to leave me a review.... I'll be publishing another update shortly with Game Center leaderboards, and would love to incorporate your feedback.</p>
