<p>Shigesato Itoi is probably best known over here as the designer of Earthbound, one of my favorite games. I really don't know as much about him as I'd like to... I sometimes check out <a href="http://www.1101.com/index.html" title="Shigesato Itoi's website">his website</a>, but I don't have enough patience (or time at work) to read through the Japanese. A while ago I bought "Yume de aimashou," a collection of short stories by Itoi and Haruki Murakami, but only got through the introduction. If I ever start studying Japanese again, I'll probably use that book as my first project.</p>
