<p><a href="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/iTunesArtwork.png"><img src="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/iTunesArtwork-150x150.png" alt="Nonogram Madness 1.1 Icon" title="Nonogram Madness 1.1 Icon" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-112" /></a>Hey, so a new version of Nonogram Madness is out! I'd been wanting to do an update since the first version was released, since I boned the keyword list for the app when I first submitted it (you can't change keywords unless you upload a new version). This update makes Nonogram Madness an "universal" app, which means it has both iPhone/iPod touch and iPad versions in the same app. To make the iPad version, I upscaled all my art assets by 2x, and introduced some new controls since the screen is so much larger. Instead of manipulating the crosshairs to mark blocks, you can just directly touch the puzzle grid. I also tweaked the "mark" behavior, so that it makes it a bit easier to mark lots of blocks at the same time, and added 10 new levels just to round out the update. Oh yeah, there's a new icon too. I'm not sure how I feel about the icon, but I think it depicts the game more accurately than the generic "N" logo. If you've already got the game, make sure to update! Otherwise, you can grab it on <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=0VdnAOV054A&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fnonogram-madness%252Fid386461624%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30">the App Store</a>.</p>
