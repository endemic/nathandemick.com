So, here's the picture update this weekend.

* [My friend Dave eating ramen](/images/more_japan/dave.jpg). Yes, that's black 
  pepper in his bowl. No, he's not stoned, it's just a bad picture. Maybe I'll 
  get away with posting this 'cos I don't think he reads this page. Probably if 
  he knew he'd beat the snot outta me.
* [Yet another blurry night shot of the river I go jogging along](/images/more_japan/jogging_river.jpg).
* [Another picture of my apartment](/images/more_japan/apt.jpg), because that's 
  where I've been most of this weekend. Mmm... videogames. My clothes are all 
  hung up because dryers don't exist in Japan. If you walk by an apartment 
  building on a nice day, you can see that everyone and their mother has 
  clothes, futons, etc. out drying in the sun. Yes, that is a copy of Jackie 
  Chan's autobiography on the floor.
* [A picture of me](/images/more_japan/me.jpg), because, let's face it, that's 
  the real reason you visit this page. NOW BUY ME STUFF FROM MY AMAZON.COM 
  WISHLIST, YOU TOOLS!
