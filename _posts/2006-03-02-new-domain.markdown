  content: So, what are you going to do with it?
- author: Nathan
  content: I guess it'll be a more professional/career-style page, as opposed to this
    nonsense. It was free, so there was no real reason not to.

  content: Are you still going to host my website?  :)
- author: Nathan
  content: Yeah, of course. I was thinking of retiring the bitter-gamer.com domain,
    but then I found out that I had another free domain registration, and could host
    it with my current plan. So now I've got both. I might drop bitter-gamer.com,
    but you can still have stuff wherever I end up.

I registered <a href="http://www.nathandemick.com">nathandemick.com</a> today. If I was really crazy, I'd also get other variations on my name, but I'm not crazy. What I really wanted was demick.com, so my email address could be nathan@demick.com. However, demick.com is taken by some crazy shipping firm located in London. They've had the domain for a long time, but it's just a lockâ€”there's nothing there. I guess I could settle for using demick.net, which my family <em>does</em> own.
