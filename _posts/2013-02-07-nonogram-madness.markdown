    Nathan,

    I am looking to hire someone to develop an iOS game. It will be simple gameplay integrated with a backed server (parse.com for example)....let me know if you'd like to talk about the project.

<p>Been a quiet month or so since my last update. I haven't been very productive in terms of new work, unfortunately. The purchase of my new Android phone got me thinking about doing some more work on my Android port of Shikaku Madness. Although it was released in June and priced at $0.99, I got maybe 10 sales in the course of 6 months, and I think 8 of those requested refunds. Probably my fault for not requiring a higher version of Android... since I have no idea how the game performs on anything less than Ice Cream Sandwich. In any case, I decided I would create a new, free version of the Android release, and integrate IAP so as to let players try the game out. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ganbarugames.shikakujs">Check it out on the Play Store.</a> I don't think it's any more successful, but more people are downloading it, at least.</p>
<p>I also spent about two weeks porting over Nonogram Madness to Javascript, and released <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ganbarugames.nonogramjs">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nonogram-madness/id596731005?mt=12">Mac OS X</a> versions. It's kind of a simplified port, mostly due to the fact that Javascript DOM performance is terrible on mobile, but I think it turned out pretty well. </p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure what my next project will be; possibly something using Unity (which I've told myself I would do for about a year now). I have an app entry in iTunes Connect that is going to expire in less than a month, so you'll see something soon. If you have any comments or suggestions about my Javascript games, drop me a line... I'd love to hear your feedback.</p>
