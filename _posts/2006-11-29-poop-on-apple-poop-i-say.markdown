Faugh. A few weeks ago I decided I needed a laptop, so I shelled out for a refurb MacBook Pro. The first laptop I owned, a refurb iBook, came in great condition, so I didn't think twice about getting another refurbished computer. This time, however, the laptop came with physical damage: there was a protrusion in the actual case, right above the latch-release button. I send it back for a replacement (after driving out to the Apple store and being told that they can't do anything, after the support rep told me to take the damaged unit there) and the <em>replacement</em> has the <b>same</b> disfigurement! <br /><br />
At this point, I was pretty fed up. I'm dropping large sacks of cash for a <em>used</em>, previous-gen machine... and they can't even ship me one that isn't messed up. Where's the "ease of use" on the ordering process? So, I got a refund. Or will, five business days after Apple gets the MacBook back. Jerks. <br /><br />
I eventually remembered what I promised myself (a couple years ago) regarding purchasing new laptop: get something small. To that end, I grabbed a <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/laptops/gateway-nx100x-ultraportable-reviewed-verdict-thin-small-and-relatively-inexpensive-195662.php">Gateway NX100X</a>. It's small, good-looking, decent-performing, and ridiculously cheap. Due to some specials, I got $400 off the list price, plus free shipping/handling. I figure that I can get my feelings of superiority from installing Linux on there, as opposed to buying overpriced hardware. ZAM!
