  content: Wait, what does the Phoenix church have to do you with you?  (I don't mean
    that in a snarky way, I'm just wondering why it's such a major blow.)
- author: Laura
  content: Oh, wait.  Do you mean the church in Phoenix, AZ, or is Phoenix the name
    of a Columbus church?

  content: '''Phoenix'' is the name of the homechurch which consists (mostly) of my
    house and the girls'' house down the street. This means that everyone is splitting
    up, going to different churches, and the houses are going to eventually be broken
    up as well.'

  content: "Ah, I see.  Sorry about the church breakup... when are the houses disintegrating?
    \ Seems like bad timing for you.  :(\r\n<br><br>\r\nGood luck with that speed
    read!  I'm chortling at your vain ambition.  \"Goblet of Fire\" is not difficult
    to read but it's LONG, like 800 pages or something.  So if you can do 100 pages
    in an hour (that's nearly two pages per minute), you'd still need 8 hours.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nHow
    are you able to see the movie tonight?  Around here, even the \"midnight premiere\"
    (which I'm not going to) doesn't take place 'til tomorrow night."

Latest news is that the Phoenix homechurch is breaking up. This is the equivalent to someone hitting me in the face with a hammer. I don't really know what to say yet.

<p>EDIT: In reality, my face hasn't been rocked that much. It was just kind of a shock to realize that there's a lot more work in the future, and that I'm not going to see some of my new friends nearly as much. Already the future is starting to show itself, and I think that things'll be good, for the most part. 

<p>Gonna try to see that darn new Harry Potter movie tonight. Never got a chance to read the book first... perhaps I'll do a speed-read after work today.
