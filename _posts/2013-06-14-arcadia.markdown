It's been a slow couple of months. A bit of "real life" upheaval (in the form of 
having to find a new job) has prevented blog updates. I haven't been completely 
idle during this time, though, and have been working on a few small projects, 
two of which I'll detail here.

The first is a [Game Center plugin for Apache Cordova](https://github.com/endemic/cordova-gamecenter-plugin).
I wanted to learn how to write a Cordova plugin, and as far as I know, no one 
else has written a plugin for Game Center. I'm probably the only person who is 
stupid enough to write such a thing. It's not a 100% complete implementation, 
but has support for leaderboards, achievements, and turn-based multiplayer 
games. To test the plugin out, I wrote a 
[simple _reversi_ game](https://github.com/endemic/2p-reversi), which will allow 
users to play via asynchronous multiplayer. The game itself isn't quite done (I 
hit a roadblock in that I only had one iOS device to test on), but I'm hoping to 
get back in and finish it soon.

The other project is a 
[minimalistic &lt;canvas>-based game framework](https://github.com/endemic/arcadia). 
What started as some experimentation with the canvas tag turned into something 
more like a full-fledged game framework. I use the term "full-fledged" pretty 
loosely, of course. It has support for game scenes, shape-based sprites, and 
particle emitters, and handles keyboard/mouse/touch input. My big source of 
inspiration was the [Flash-based games](http://wonderfl.net/user/aba) of 
developer [Kenta Cho](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/). While it's 
relatively easy to create a simple 2D game in Flash, a lot of the boilerplate 
code you might want is missing from JavaScript. This framework might help you 
out in creating prototypes that can be easily embedded into your website for 
quick feedback. If you end up wanting to publish the game (on mobile, for 
example), you can set an option when instantiating the game container that 
causes the canvas to scale to fit the size of the window, which means you could 
publish across multiple screen sizes pretty easily. I'm currently experimenting 
with making a simple [dual-stick shooter](https://github.com/endemic/yajirushi) 
using the framework.

As always, comments and suggestions are welcome. Keep programming!
