<p>Yeah, so this is ridiculous, but I'm throwing it out there: I'm bad at leaving ratings and reviews for games. Even after having published my own game on the App Store &mdash; I mean, I know firsthand that developers want reviews. I haven't even left ratings for the few games that I've written up on this blog.</p>
<p>I imagine that a fair number of other developers fall into this camp as well, so I'm making a public challenge: if you take the time to buy a game from the App Store and actually play it, leave a review! Not just a rating; take the time to think of one thing you really liked, and (optionally) one bit of constructive criticism, and slap that nonsense into iTunes. To put my money where my mouth is, I'm going to list the apps that I haven't left reviews for, then check them off as I do. I charge you to do the same. I guarantee that it'll make someone feel better about their hard work.</p>
