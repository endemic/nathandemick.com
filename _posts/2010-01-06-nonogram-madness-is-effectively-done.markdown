  content: Hey, those are kind of fun! I'd never heard of them before, but I enjoyed
    the first two puzzles. I loved the effects/graphics... did you do all that from
    scratch, or use some library?

  content: I used an Actionscript framework called "Flixel," which has been getting
    popular lately. It re-works lots of Flash conventions into more game-specific
    ideas. I did the graphics, but Flixel has particle generators and stuff to help
    with effects.

  content: Played through the first 16 on easy and puzzle 16 broke my will because
    I didn't see an easy start =).  Damn me for being lazy

<p>Seems like the last two projects I've done have had kind of lackluster ends. I've been sitting on this "mostly complete" project for a while, and while I'm still unsatisfied about certain areas (i.e. there's no music), if I don't push it out the door pretty soon it'll just sit and stagnate. So, here we go: <a href="http://nathandemick.com/flash/nonogram-madness/" title="Nonogram Madness">Nonogram Madness</a>.</p>
<p>(If anyone cares, let me know what you think in the comments. The puzzles <em>kinda</em> progress in difficulty, but they haven't been balanced at all, and some of them are pretty bad. There, you've been warned.)</p>
