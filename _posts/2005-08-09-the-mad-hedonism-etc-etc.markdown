  content: damn, butros, those both look nice.  I'd have to throw my vote behind widget1,
    though.  Once you have this thing working, whatever it is exactly, let me know
    and I'll throw it up on the site... maybe other mac users listen to the station,
    who knows?

  content: "grahh, I was hoping for some kind of consensus on which style of glassy
    bevel effect was better. So far, it's my sister and soulman for #1, and chalupa
    and me for #2. <p>\r\nthe widget is basically a small html/css/java program which
    runs in a program called Dashboard (similar to <a href=\"http://www.konfabulator.com\">Konfabulator</a>).\r\nall
    this widget will do is connect to radio shatterbloom. for some reason, other internet
    radio widgets seemed really convenient, so I figured I'd bang one up myself."

Be prepared for a post which has no real overall purpose or meaning, but basically consists of me babbling into the void. Anyway, things are happily going along here. Last Saturday I went to Lincoln for the day; hung out with many people, including, but not limited to, Ben, Gil, Tyler, Henry, and Poobs. I also converted my cash/Traveller's Cheques into REAL MONEY. I took a bit of a hit in the ol' conversion ratio, but I decided that I didn't care anymore. There has recently been a new (1.11) patch for Diablo2, which adds more new content (new bosses, plus a new uber charm). I installed the game and played for a bit, but then quit because it's no fun playing by oneself. Although I am a bit sad, because the character name "Cindergorilla" for a fire sorceress was classic. <p>
OK, I lied. Here's the real reason for this post. While I was still in Japan I started trying to make a <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">Dashboard widget</a>; one that will connect to the <a href="http://radio.shatterbloom.com">internet radio station</a> of me good buddy Soulman. Now, using the RealPlayer plugin and CSS and whatnot is not a big problem. There was one weird issue that I couldn't resolve, but right now I don't feel like trolling messageboards looking to see if anyone else has had the same problem (although I'm sure they have). My issue is making a pretty graphic to go with the widget. After taking a gander at a few tutorials, I came up with some test images. Most of the Dashboard widgets try to simulate glassy, reflective surfaces, and I made two different designs to try to emulate the popular look. <a href="./images/random/widget_design1.jpg">Design One</a> and <a href="./images/random/widget_design2.jpg">Design Two</a>. These are works in progress, so feel free to leave comments. The white area at the bottom will be for the player controls; yes, it's mostly just wasted space. Anyway, tell me, which style looks better?
