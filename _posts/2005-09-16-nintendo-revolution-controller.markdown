Just got in this morning, and the first thing I see on Wired is shots of the new Nintendo system controller. Obviously there was a lot of speculation on the final form it would take, but this is even more of a departure than most people imagined, I'm sure. It basically looks like a remote control, but with sensors that can detect rotation and movement.

As I may have said in the past, I think the future of games revolves around tactile input, such as using a stylus (something Nintendo has already done). From what I see of this concept, I'm actually rather excited. Using the remote to control aiming in FPS games is going to be quite intuitive. Unfortunately, I'll probably have to wait until Wal-Mart gets demo units before I can try this sucker out.
