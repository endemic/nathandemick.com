  content: "I agree completely.  In Chicago, I was running nothing but wireless, including
    my desktop.  As a result, I couldn't transfer files larger than 3mb, or the router
    would crash.\r\n\r\nAfter my move, I hardwired <i>everything<i>.  That includes
    running a 100' ethernet cable out my upstairs window, down the building to the
    basement, through a cable hole, across the ceiling, and up through the floor to
    the xbox and media center.  Pain in the ass, but it's stable and fast as hell.\r\n\r\nWireless
    is only good for taking the notebook to the coffee shop down the street."

I really do. It bothers me.<br>
Sure it's handy to be able to take a laptop around your house and go where ever but woooohoooo that's all it's really good for.<br>
I have a desktop and all I really do is download shite and chat and download more shite and I am forced to use a wireless connection because my roommates don't want a bunch of wires running around the house.<br> 
But I ask this question: <i>What's so damn wrong with wires, huh?</i> <br>I mean, what's so frickin' great about wifi (aside from the fact that it's easy to steal from idiots that don't have their WEP set up).
I don't remember ever having any trouble networking with just a cable modem and a router and an additional hub that ran wires to the basement. That setup was fine. Everything worked. Soulseek, AIM, Limewire all gave me no guff.<br>
But now, ooooh now, it's port fowarding this and DHCP that and blah bnlahb lahblabhlabahb.<br>
I just want my wires back, that's all.
