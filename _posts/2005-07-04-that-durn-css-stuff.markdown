    the dividers for some reason; I'm checking it out.

So, you might notice the page is lookin' a bit wonky. This is because I had the bright idea to change the layout to use CSS instead of nested tables. Unfortunately, most people (including myself) use the &lt;p> tag when posting instead of using two &lt;br>'s. This screws with the CSS, since I changed the &lt;p> tag to format text in a certain way. I'm still kinda thinking about ways around this, so for now just use the &lt;br> tag.
