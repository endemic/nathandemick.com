<pre>I know I should get next to you
You've got a look that made me think you're cool
But it's just sexual attraction
Not something real so I'd rather keep on wackin' 

Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
Won't happen to me anymore 

I've known a lot of girls before
What's the harm in knowing one more?
Maybe we could even get together
Maybe you could break my heart next summer 

Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
Won't happen to me anymore 

It's a crying shame I'm all alone
Not with you, nor her, nor anyone
Won't you knock me on my head?
Crack it open let me out of here 

Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
Won't happen to me anymore 

Why bother (why bother)
It's gonna hurt me (it's gonna hurt me)
It's gonna kill when (why bother)
You desert me (it's gonna hurt me)
Why bother (why bother)
It's gonna hurt me (it's gonna hurt me)
Why bother?
It's gonna hurt me </pre>
