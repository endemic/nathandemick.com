Tonight was the homechurch Thanksgiving dinner, and also the last church meeting. Lots of good food, and not many dry eyes by the end of the night. I guess Bill was right with that "parting is such sweet sorrow" bit. Now everyone is making plans about where to go next; it seems that the men are going in two groups, with me staying with Phil and Soulman. I also have an offer to check out churches not in the college group. I'm feeling as if I'm being dragged along by an inexorable tide: if I wanted to, I could exercise total independence, but I don't want to. We'll see what the next week brings.
<p>I made the turkey tonight, and it wasn't a total failure. Word.
