  content: Indeed, those furry pants (and Mr. Sandwich) got me many stares and laughs.
    They were constructed by Whipple.

    the man could make furry pants!  hopefully they didn't have any pants rabbits

Got back from Boston last night around 2:15 in the AM. Too much driving, but the trip itself was worth it. The main plan was to go on <a href="http://www.scul.org">SCUL</a>'s Holloween ride on Saturday night, then stick around and watch a pour by the <a href="http://http://babel.massart.edu/ironguild/">Iron Guild</a> of MassArt. The ride on Saturday was rescheduled due to bad weather, and in the end both events were rolled into one, as the destination of the SCUL ride was changed to the pour site. 
<p>I took some photos, which I will upload shortly; an alternate source is Soulman's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewmsoell/">Flickr account</a>. Unfortunately, my camera is absolute bollocks for shooting without a flash (i.e. no night photos), so I didn't get many pictures of the ride or pour. They were blurry at best. <p>
EDIT: I made my own <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53872226@N00/">Flickr account</a>. Check-a-check it out.
