    I don't know that it's trite, but I guess I just don't understand.  I tried breakout and tetris, and I couldn't tell if they were trying to be ironic with the changes or what.  At any rate, the game aspect wasn't fun, and the changes weren't all that clever.

    But to each his own, right?

  content: Yep, that's true. I should have said the <em>idea</em> behind the games
    was trite... as in "I'm challenging your notions of the way things should work."
    I guess I just find it boring.

<p><a href="http://www.retrosabotage.com/" title="Retro Sabotage">Retro Sabotage</a> &ndash; a moderately interesting site, based on remaking certain classic games in Flash, but adding small, game-breaking details. Definitely a commendable effort, but slightly too trite for my tastes.</p>
