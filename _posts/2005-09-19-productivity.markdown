What's that, eh? Laundry list of things I did today, in chronological order:<p>
->Ran 3 miles<br>
->Got my teeth checked/cleaned (they're beautiful!)<br>
->Applied for 3 (more) jobs<br>
->Deposited some money from traveller's cheques my bank rejected<br>
->Filled in a pothole in my parents' driveway<br>
->Dug out an old birdhouse in the backyard<br>
->Made arrangements to begin an independent web design contract
<p>
Gotta stave off the boredom!
