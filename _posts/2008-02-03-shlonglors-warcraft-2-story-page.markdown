<p>During a search of the archives, I came across a .zip file documenting what we all did before in-game recorded replays: wrote  descriptions (or "stories," if you will) about our gaming exploits. This idea gained popularity due to Geoff Frazier (Shlonglor), who made the whole of his old 'Story' page available at one point. I've spent a few pleasant moments reveling in nostalgia due to reading these, and a cursory Google search doesn't turn them up anywhere else, so I thought I might mirror the pages here. If reading these stories makes you want to play Warcraft 2, send me an email and we'll set something up =]</p>
