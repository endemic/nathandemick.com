<p>So, as an ongoing effort to try more iOS games and learn from other developers, I've decided to resurrect the dreaded "game review." This'll hopefully force me to think a bit more critically about some of the games I'm playing, and it might help out the random reader who is looking for something interesting on the App Store.</p>
<p><a href="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bqlsi-loading.png"><img src="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bqlsi-loading-150x150.png" alt="" title="bqlsi-loading" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33" /></a>This week I'm playing a game called <a href="http://www.procyon-studio.co.jp/bqlsi/">BQLSI STAR LASER</a> (yes, all caps unfortunately). The only reason I'd heard of it was because I was browsing around the website of <a href="http://www.procyon-studio.com/">Procyon Studio</a>, a company founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasunori_Mitsuda">Yasunori Mitsuda</a>. Mitsuda is most well-known as the composer of a number of Squaresoft games, such as <a href="http://na.square-enix.com/ctds/">Chrono Trigger</a> and <a href="http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/">Xenogears</a>. Well, apparently as a side project, he produced a small iOS game, as well as created the music/SFX for it. Since I'm a fan of his music, I decided to try out the game.</p>
<p><a href="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bqlsi-options.png"><img src="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bqlsi-options-150x150.png" alt="" title="bqlsi-options" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-34" /></a>The game itself is actually pretty interesting. It's a great example of how a touchscreen device can create and use any sort of interface the program creators can think up. In this case, the UI paradigm is that of an old-school LCD handheld game (<a href="http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Tiger/SpaceInvaders.htm">similar to this</a>). It's actually very well done, with clever little touches that add a bit of verisimilitude. When you first load the app, you're presented with two empty battery sockets, which you have to touch to insert batteries. Then the game actually begins. BQLSI is a shooting game,  and true to its' inspiration, it limits itself to two types of enemy objects that appear on the screen. There are the aliens you have to shoot, and asteroids (or whatever) that you have to avoid. For being so limited in terms of "objects," the game is actually pretty varied and creative. While you just blast enemies at first, soon you have to dodge asteroids, and navigate through collapsing rock corridors. It's definitely challenging, and a fun throwback to days of gaming before the Game Boy.</p>
<p><a href="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bqlsi-action-2.png"><img src="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bqlsi-action-2-150x150.png" alt="" title="bqlsi-action-2" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32" /></a>I only really have two complaints regarding this game. The first is that there's no music, just short jingles when you finish a level. I was really hoping for some catchy tunes from Mitsuda. Annoyingly, in place of the music there's a low-pitched hum that plays continually... I'm not sure what that's supposed to emulate. None of my LCD games made noises like that. The second is that sometimes your fingers drift off the controls when you're concentrating on watching the gameplay. There's really nothing that can be done about this; with no physical buttons, you just have to train yourself to know where the controls are in a game like BQLSI.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I'd have to say that BQLSI STAR LASER is a solid game. It has some minor annoyances, but I'm glad to support interesting games from Japanese developers. Let's hope that the sequel gets some sweet, sweet chiptunes.</p>
