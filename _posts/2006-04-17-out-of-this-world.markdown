This was a game which I didn't play, due to the fact that I wasn't much of a computer game player back in the 80s. It's a side-scrolling adventure game, in the vein of Prince of Persia. Looks like the author has redone the game with vector grapics and hi-res backgrounds; I'm gonna have to give it a shot.
