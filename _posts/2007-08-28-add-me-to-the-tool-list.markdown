So, uh, yeah... after that long-winded diatribe the other week denouncing Apple's product lineup, I, for some reason, got it into my head that I would buy a Mac Pro. To be honest, I can't really think of the reasons why... they were basically a lot of small things that added up (i.e. just got on salary, work in a Mac shop, nice virtualization software). I figured I'd sell the PC and use the laptop until I had some cash squirreled away to devote to a $2.5k machine. Well, I told my employer that I was seriously considering getting the Mac Pro, and he went ahead and bought me Photoshop CS3 and VMWare Fusion today. Plus I'm going to get his 20-inch Cinema display as a hand-me-down. Well, that was enough for me to take the plunge and buy this stupidly freaking expensive computer. I did get a refurb, which netted me about 15% off the list price for the Quad 2.66 GHz system. A pretty big justification was the fact that I can probably use this machine reliably for at least 3 years (barring component failure); it's just that overpowered. So anyway. You guys (read: Andy) can make fun of me now.</p>
