Finally, I got the ridiculous amount of cash I was hiding in my apartment converted to Traveller's Checks. I was getting all paranoid, especially after reading The Sound and the Fury (one of the characters gets a bunch of cash ripped offa him). For a brief moment, I was a millionaire! Ok, a YEN millionaire, which I guess isn't that impressive. However, it was the most cash I've ever handled. Here's some advice to all y'all: don't save your money in cash, it's not worth the worry. Fortunately, the bank employees didn't blink at my insane desire to change a million yen, so everything went ok. Now all I gotta worry about is packing and convincing the boss to let me skip my last Saturday.
