During my formative years, I was a sucker for Nintendo's marketing machine. In the summer of 1994, it was in full swing, promoting a Super Nintendo accessory called the Super Game Boy &mdash; a specialized cartridge that allowed you to play Game Boy games on your TV, via the SNES. Although one of the main advantages of the Game Boy was its portability, the screen on the device was so bad that playing on a CRT was a considerable upgrade. The Super Game Boy also allowed for additional features, such as multiple color palettes on the same screen and enhanced music/sound effects. Of course, most Game Boy developers never bothered to add these features into their games, since it would be a lot of work for a dubious return. Nintendo made an effort with a few of their first-part games, and the standout title in this regard was a remake of the seminal classic, Donkey Kong (often referred to as _Donkey Kong '94_).

I used the word "remake," but it's fair to say that this game goes way above and beyond the limited four stage scope of the original arcade title. The game starts off in a similar fashion, with the first four levels more or less mirroring the arcade version. After completing the fourth level, instead of looping back to the first in an endless grind of boredom, Kong grabs the girl and leads Mario on a chase through nine different game worlds. While the core mechanics of the game are similar to the original, this new version gives Mario greater mobility, with backflips and back handsprings. He also can fall from greater heights without instantly dying, which is a welcome change. These moves are what is needed to complete the litany of new levels, the majority of which involve finding a key, then returning with it to a locked door, behind which Kong (with Pauline) has absconded.

Every fourth level involves a direct encounter with Donkey Kong. The "sub-boss" stages are similar in nature to the original, where Mario needs to ascend to the top of the stage, avoiding obstacles thrown (or otherwise generated) by DK. The final level of each world is a more traditional boss fight, where Mario needs to hit Kong with three barrels in order to win.

I played the heck out of this game, but mostly on a handheld Game Boy. On a whim, last week I busted out my copy for a playthrough, on the Super Game Boy this time. While replacing the save battery, I noticed that the cartridge has the "greatest hits" label... in my original box. Not sure exactly how the heck that happened, as I'm usually pretty meticulous with my game collection. I think it's one of those mysteries that'll never be solved. Anyway. What about the game itself? My verdict is that it holds up surprisingly well, and is probably one of the best titles for the Game Boy system. While each individual level is fairly short, there are a veritable boatload of them, for a surprising amount of game play. As previously mentioned, the game does have a save feature, and allows you to save after each boss encounter (which translates to every four levels). While this might seem punitive in the days of autosaving, it was a decent affordance back in the day, especially for a mobile title where a gaming session might end on short notice.

One thing I might mention is that Donkey Kong is quite easy &mdash; each stage has three collectables, which, if obtained, allow you to play a bonus game for extra 1ups at the end of the level. Additionally, after every boss encounter, the remaining time on each level is added up, and you're given a 1up for each 100 seconds. Both these methods of earning extra lives ensures that you get up to 99 of them in short order. During my playthrough, I purposely avoided the collectables, as the bonus games quickly become rather boring after the first few times you play them.

This game is quite an enjoyable diversion, and well worth your time, especially on the Super Game Boy. It's a shame that more games didn't take advantage of the Super Game Boy features, but if you own all the required accoutrements, it's the definitive way to play.
