<p>As you can see, since announcing that I was going to start dabbling in Unity, I actually haven't done anything! The cause of this is the fact that I'm currently ~20 hours in to the new Zelda game, Skyward Sword. Basically I'm trying to recharge and remind myself why I like games in the first place by actually playing one. </p>
<p>Fortunately, Skyward Sword is pretty good. While it isn't as purely groundbreaking as Ocarina of Time, it does add a number of new gameplay mechanics that make the game feel fresh. My only criticism so far is that parts of the game are a bit padded (i.e. to progress, you need to fetch an item located in an area you've previously completed), but that is almost inevitable with any large-scale adventure game.</p>
<p>I've been talking the game up to co-workers, and even though I haven't completed it yet, I can wholeheartedly recommend that you dust off your Wii and start swinging the remote like a crazy person. It's a true "Nintendo" game, which is about as high of praise as I can give anything these days. Once I finish, I've got a few ideas in mind for new projects to start, so we'll see where those lead.</p>
