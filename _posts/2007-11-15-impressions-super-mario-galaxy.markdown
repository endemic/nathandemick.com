After finally getting a copy of the game and playing for, oh I don't know, two 
minutes over the past two days, I thought I'd write up my initial impressions of 
the game. As we all know, I wanted this game to transport me to a magical gaming 
nirvana, but that doesn't happen much these days (last time I felt "compelled" 
to play a game was when I discovered the awesome combat of Final Fantasy XII... 
I actually would wake up early and play it before work. Then I got tired of it 
after a week, since level grinding is level grinding).

Here's the deal: it's pretty cool. I have to come to the realization that I just 
can't have Mario 64 ever again. That game was the reason for the jacked-up N64 
controller, and although subsequent Nintendo controllers have been even _more_ 
jacked, none of them have the capability for camera control that the N64 had. We 
just gotta cope with it.

Mario Galaxy does what it can, though. The camera is quite a bit better than 
Mario Sunshine's; in fact, it feels very similar to a Zelda-style system, in 
that pressing "C" will center the camera behind Mario. I wasn't adjusting the 
camera very often, actually, simply due to the nature of the way Galaxy works. 
Most levels are made up of small (usually spherical) planetoids, and the camera 
is usually pointing almost straight down on Mario, and has to adjust very 
quickly because of the constant curvature of the "planet." So far I haven't 
gotten frustrated with the camera, which is good news.

I'm still not totally sold on the Wii remote's functionality, though. You use it 
to direct a cursor to pick up/shoot Star Shards, little bits of colorful debris 
that stun enemies. It just doesn't seem to be that useful... it might have been 
cool to be able to pick up coins or something. You can also shake the remote or 
nunchuck to make Mario spin &ndash; what might now be considered his default 
attack. Spinning tromps enemies, as well as breaks crates and crystals. Jumping 
on enemies seems to be a bit harder now than it was in the past, mostly because 
of the crazy differences in the camera.

Right now I'm loving the fact that each area in the game is more linear. We 
don't have to run through the same levels in the game over and over, it seems.

Expect a full review to come once I have a bit more time to actually play the 
darned game.

__EDIT:__ Yeah, it's good. I played for a while this morning before work, and 
have found little negative to say... maybe the worst thing is that you go 
through the levels so quickly.
