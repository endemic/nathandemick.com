A few weeks ago I had the strange desire to play videogames. All my friends hear me complain that I don't have enough time to play games anymore, but on occasion I'll have a weekend where nothing is going on. It was then that I decided to rent Black, a first-person shooter for the current-gen consoles. I hadn't really researched the game much before its release, but from cursory reading of gaming websites, I had obtained a vaguely positive impression. I was also somewhat intrigued by the advertising: the TV commercials presented the idea that the game was all about a destructable environment, and a lot of shooting. 
<br /><br />
With all this in mind, I went to a local Blockbuster to sign up for a membership and rent the game. This was undoubtedly a mistake, as I was basically forced to sign over my soul for the membership, and then pay $8 ($8!!) to rent the game. I can remember when I paid A DOLLAR to rent a game, but that's beside the point. I opted to rent the Xbox version, since I was used to playing FPS games (read: Halo 2) on the Xbox controller.
<br /><br />
Booting the game up, I am almost immediately disappointed. The video introducing the story behind the game is shot in a very poor fashion, and cobbled together with some even worse editing. It was obviously done this way on purpose, but the end result is something not very enjoyable to watch. Also, the video (and the introduction on every level) is not skippable. The story is presented in a piecemeal way, with a soldier being debriefed after an incident: his recollections of what happened are the levels played by the player. I was able to come away with the knowledge that the soldier was trying to find some weapons smuggler, but not much beyond that. 
<br /><br />
In terms of the actual game, I was also less than impressed. Here I was, led to believe that the maps were totally dynamic, and could be destroyed at will. Unfortunately, not true. Structures in each level can be destroyed only in strategic places, such as when an enemy is standing behind them. This means that almost every enemy is hiding behind some destructable, and the player is expected to blow up the enemy's cover before riddling him with bullets. Such events are sadly predictable. You'll notice that, when being shot at by tons of hidden enemies, that they conveniently placed a gas tanker near their cover. It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure out where to shoot. The gist of all this is that the environments are NOT dynamic, and in fact rather boring. 
<br /><br />
Another problem with the game is that the emphasis is on shooting: a lot. Trying to sneak up on baddies and get rid of them with a silenced pistol is pointless; a direct shot to the head won't drop these guys. The way to play is running out, guns blazing, and keep shooting 'till they drop. Although I tend to prefer games this way (wanton violence), I also like to be precise, and play the game the way I want to. Nothing is more frustrating than trying to play a game in a certain way, and being hampered in that due to constrictions placed by the developers. 
<br /><br />
In a world where emphasis is placed on graphical quality, Black fails to impress. It looks slightly better than, say, Quake 2. Probably on par with Quake 3. Enough said.
<br /><br />
The level design and game goals are yet more frustrating factors. Too often, the levels are extremely open-ended and bland, with no distinguishing scenery to give players any sort of landmark. Many, many times, I literally wandered in circles within each map. As we all know, another extremely frustrating aspect of gaming is not knowing where to go next. An expansive game world with many things to do is one thing, but non-linearity (including that in map design) can only be taken so far. The goals within each level are also trite and boring: all about collecting certain numbers of arbitrary objects, or destroying them. If the player exits the level without completing a certain number of these objectives, they must replay the map. 
<br /><br />
Overall, Black is a disappointment. Its many problems make the game not even worth a rental. Which is why I didn't finish it.
