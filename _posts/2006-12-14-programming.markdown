Man, I wouldn't get anything done at all if it wasn't for <a href="http://www.cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>. I built myself a time-tracking/invoicing tool by basically just creating a database schema, then telling Cake to create my program. I'm so freaking lazy that the program wouldn't have gotten written otherwise. It's crazy easy to make functional changes in your database, too. I had to add another table representing my clients, and relate it to my projects, which literally took all of two minutes. I think that tomorrow morning I'm actually going to give this page some of the long-overdue functionality that I've been avoiding. I thought that I would build a blog-style program with Rails, but I just can't justify memorizing more Ruby syntax when Rails still isn't supported on the host I'm building lots of sites on.<br /><br />
By the way, the <a href="http://www.nathandemick.com/links">Linker</a> is back up, for those who care.
