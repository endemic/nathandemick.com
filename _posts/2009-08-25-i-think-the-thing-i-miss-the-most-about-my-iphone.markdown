<p>I think the thing I miss the most about my iPhone is the fact that it was <i>from the future</i>. If my high school-aged self had a chance to look forward in time and see the computer hardware his future self was using, he probably wouldn&#8217;t have been that impressed. Sure, computers now have faster processors and more RAM, but we&#8217;ve been on an upward trajectory for years now&#8230; Moore&#8217;s Law, and all that. The iPhone is like a convergence of <i>awesome</i>&#8230; my past self would have been amazed at all the functionality of the device, which you used your darn fingers to interface with. Sadly, the phone I have now, even though it was released recently, reflects some 2004-vintage tech. Un-inspiring.</p>
