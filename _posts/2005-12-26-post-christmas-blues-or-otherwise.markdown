    I don't get it. I think the girl who drew it was just on drugs. She is our contact

<p>I guess the bloke on the right is supposed to be me. 
<p>Hope everyone had a festive Christmas, etc. I had a pretty good one (way better than last year, anyway). Went to a late-night church service, and then spent some time with my uncle's family in Chillicothe. 
<p>Right now I am at work, and feeling bad; mostly because of the crap weather and the fact that all the shops are closed. I can't even get coffee across the street. English breakfast tea will have to suffice, boiled in my cheapo hotpot. 
<p>Still haven't written about my Nintendo DS, or uploaded pictures of the Grand Canyon from my most recent trip. Nothing to do this evening, so perhaps I'll get on that.
<p>The mission today is to get over the Monday slump.
