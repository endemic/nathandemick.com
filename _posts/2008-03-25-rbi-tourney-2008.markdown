<p>Every year, my friend Soulman goes to an RBI Baseball (yes, <em>that</em> RBI Baseball) tournament in Chicago. This year, he made a <a href="http://andy.teamsoell.com/archive/34-daily/44-rbi2008.html" title="video tribute to the festivities">video tribute to the festivities</a>. Watch as history is made by The Snake winning his <b>first ever</b> game. Very amusingly well-done!</p>
