    Saturday Morning Anime spot. I have it on VHS somewhere, but I don't remember
    much of it. Maybe I should download it...

    I made it so all users can edit comments, but obviously if it starts getting abused,
    I''ll erase your internet existance. Also, the linker doesn''t delete old links
    now; you can view all the links or only the most recent ones.'

  content: "now that you mention it I do remember seeing it, well... clips from the
    movie placed between anime stuff on sci-fi saturday.<br> \r\nI remember Cloud
    the most. I hate that one... sure it's pretty art and crap but the music is boring
    and well, it's just boring.<p>\r\nOn a side note I found a torrent for the live
    action Casshern movie.<p>\r\n<strike>http://www.torrentspy.com/directory.asp?mode=torrentdetails&id=334667</strike><br>\r\nIt

Remember a little movie called <a href=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=828>Robot Carnival</a>?<br>
No?<p>
Well, probably because you've never seen it.<br>
If you want to see it, <a href=http://isohunt.com/download.php?mode=bt&id=3049994>click here then.</a> If you've seen it and want to see it again... click on the link stupid.
