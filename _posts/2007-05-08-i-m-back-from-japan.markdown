Appropriately enough, I found an <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070507/od_uk_nm/oukoe_uk_japan_cyberhome">article about people sleeping in manga caf&eacute;s in Japan</a>. You can get a five or six hour block of time for maybe 700 yen, which is way cheaper than the cheapest of hotels. Of course, it's loud and annoying, but better than sleeping on the street. Plus you can play games, watch movies, surf the net, or read manga while you're there. Some places even have a drink bar.<br /><br />
I actually did this once, after I was at a club all night and had to stay in Tokyo to pick up my visiting cousin. It was better than staying up all night, but I still felt pretty bad afterwards (I maybe got 2-3 hours of sleep).
