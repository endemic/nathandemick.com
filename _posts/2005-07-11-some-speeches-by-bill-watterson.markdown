  content: "One of my English teachers gave us a copy of the cartoon from which this
    quote comes:  \"I used to hate writing assignments, but now I enjoy them. I realized
    that the purpose of writing is to inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning,
    and inhibit clarity. With a little practice, writing can be an intimidating and
    impenetrable fog!\"\r\n\r\nHaha... sadly true."
