The Nintendo Revolution has a <a href="http://revolution.nintendo.com/">new, stupid name</a>.
<br /><br />
There's this game called <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3149858&did=1">Loco Roco</a> for the PSP which looks like a mix between Gish [<a href="/archives/gish.html">link 1</a>, <a href="http://www.chroniclogic.com/index.htm?gish.htm">link 2</a>] and <a href="http://www.rainemu.com/games/game/cameltry/">Camel Try</a>. Check out some <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/download?cId=3143805">gameplay vids</a>. I tried to get my roommate to download the demo, since he has a PSP, but he's a sack and won't do it.
