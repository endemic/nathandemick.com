So I applied for a part-time job at the Apple Store in Columbus, basically just for the heck of it. I need some regular hours, and it might not be a bad place to work. I can get a discount on Apple crap, and if I can work enough hours for health insurance, that'd be the best.<Br /><br />
Anyway, the "hiring event." I go in, and there are about 13 other people... first they have us pair off and then tell everybody about the person you talked to. Next, find three items in the store that are "must-haves" for a new Macintosh owner (my group's answers: AppleCare warranty extension, Airport Express, and a printer). Finally, two questions: "What are you famous for?" and "Why do you want to work for Apple?" Doesn't sound like much, but with 14 people, it took over an hour. I don't know if I can handle the "culture," i.e. "My life is defined by the brand of computer I own," but I'm doing nothing else at the moment, so I'll ride the situation out. At the least, it was an amusing experience, plus a look at how the beast (Apple) operates.
