<p>To be honest, I feel that cocos2d-iphone doesn't really require <em>that</em> much knowledge of Objective-C, at least in my experience so far. I know the basics of the language, but really have yet to delve deeply. However, I realize that I've been posting cocos2d tutorials without actually doing an intro to Objective-C. From a practical standpoint, the big differences between Objective-C and C++ are syntax (obviously) and memory management. </p>
<p>With cocos2d, memory management has not been an issue for me, since all cocos2d objects are "autoreleased," that is, you don't have to deallocate their memory when you're finished using them. Basically you can "fire and forget." The Objective-C syntax is slightly wonky, but once you look through some example code and work through some tutorials, you'll get the hang of it.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go super in-depth and make an Obj-C tutorial right now, but I figured I'd share some links that have helped me out a lot.</p>
