<p>By watching television one should be able to guess that no matter how old you get, the same bullshit is always waiting to haunt you&#8230; but for whatever reason I reasoned that problems, no matter how complex, are in someway bound and finite. And in that reasoning, I came to the subconscience conclusion that if I work all of the existing ones out, I could actually live in peace&#8230; Sadly, this assumption was clearly wrong.</p>
