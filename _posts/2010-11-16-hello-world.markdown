<p>This has been a long time in coming, but finally I'm gonna get a blog up and running for Ganbaru Games. The goals for this site are partly selfish and partly altruistic. Well, OK, mostly selfish.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write tips &amp; tricks regarding game making, especially (of course) relating to iOS. I've been helped out a lot by other game developers who have taken time to write tutorials and whatnot on their blogs, so I'd like to return the favor.</li>
<li>Write updates about my own published &amp; upcoming games &mdash; I guess there's Twitter and whatnot, but I'd like a central self-hosted hub as well.</li>
<li>Get back into writing game reviews (focusing on iOS, of course). It'll probably be good source of inspiration to see what other developers are doing with the platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as frequency, I'm going to <em>try</em> to post at least once per week. So, that's the plan... hope to see you return over the coming months!</p>
