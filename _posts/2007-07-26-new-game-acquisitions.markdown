<p>Visited <a href="http://www.play-asia.com">Play-Asia.com</a>, and was taken in by their weekly special: a Japanese  copy of Meteos for $15. Next thing I knew, I was also grabbing Guilty Gear XX: Accent Core &mdash; another long-awaited game. Meteos is a DS puzzle game produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, of <em>Lumines</em> fame. I really don't know much else about it, except that it's supposed to be good. Lumines was pretty awesome, so I don't feel like I'm taking too big of a risk here. I've wanted a copy of Guilty Gear for a darn long time; I bought Isuka in Japan, but it's not very fun. There's a reason why 2D fighting games are mainly for two players.</p>
