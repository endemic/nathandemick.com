Is it bad if I start to laugh maniacally when I think about my remaining limited time of English teaching? I consider all the classes I hate (read: 90%), and the thought of never teaching them again fills me with an evil glee.<br><br>
Oh, hey, one thing I won't miss about Japan: old people on bikes. Everyone has the EXACT SAME BIKE here, which is hardly suprising. The unfortunate thing is that these bikes have a regular clamp brake for the front wheel, and some sort of disc brake for the rear. The rear brake ALWAYS makes HORRIBLE SQUEALING noises whenever it is used, on ALL BIKES. Imagine that you're waiting for a stoplight or something, then this old person rides up beside you, and then your eardrum EXPLODES. Notice how I used all caps for emphasis!
