I had some unexpected downtime the other day, and was idly browsing through Nintendo Switch Online's emulator collections. I hadn't looked at the Game Boy options in a while, and saw that Nintendo had added Super Mario Land &mdash; I have some fond memories of the "shmup" stages of the game, so decided to give it a (re)play. "Shmup stages?!" you may ask. Indeed, this is one weird Mario game.

Of course, the experience of playing the game on a giant TV is incredibly different from playing on the original Game Boy screen, which was so washed out and blurry that it's a wonder we were able to play _anything_ on it. _Super Mario Land_ replicates (more or less) the standard "Mario" experience &mdash; downsized to the smaller screen of the handheld console. Everything feels just a little "off," however. The game physics are reminicent of the original SMB, but way jankier: jumping is much more dependent on Mario's ground velocity, and he falls like a brick when dropping from a platform. Question blocks and bricks are incredibly finicky to hit, which is unfortunate since these actions are core to Mario gameplay. 

Other strange additions include replacing the series stalwart Fire Flower with a lookalike that gives a "Super Ball" power instead. The Super Ball is the worst &mdash; instead of bouncing along the ground, it hits the ground once then continues into the sky, where there are no enemies. Technically it can bounce off other objects and stay in play, but the physics are so jank that it's difficult to actually use. Plus you can only have one Super Ball on the screen at a time, so if you throw one and miss an enemy, you have to wait for a few seconds before another can be thrown. The only redeeming aspect of the Super Ball is that it can pick up coins, but it seems hardly worth it.

The levels, while having a pretty cool and unique art direction, are also kind of uninspired from a gameplay perspective. After getting used to the weird control of the game, I pretty much just hurried through each platforming stage in order to more quickly get to the shooting levels. That's right, in addition to the other one-off weirdness of this game, there are two levels where Mario gets in vehicles for side-scrolling shooter action. To be honest, these levels aren't even that interesting as shooters &mdash; just interesting compared to the rest of the game.

Aside from the shooting levels, really the only other redeeming factor of the game is the soundtrack, composed by [Hirokazu Tanaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirokazu_Tanaka). It's charming in its own lowkey way, and has a few earworms. [The ending theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRRlobAc60k) is probably the most well-known.

I can really only recommend playing Super Mario Land if you have a completionist mindset. I created save states of the game at the beginning of both the shooter levels &mdash; in case I come back to it, I can skip to the best parts.
