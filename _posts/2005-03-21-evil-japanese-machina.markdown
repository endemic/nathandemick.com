(Or, How I Almost Got Owned by a Vending Machine)

Today was my day off, in honor of some national holiday or other. Things were 
going pretty well: played FFX, read some One Piece, and in short, wasted a lot 
of time. Around 5 o'clock or so, I had a craving for some of that geek ambrosia, 
Mountain Dew. That stuff is more popular that I would have imagined: the vending 
machine outside my apartment is out of stock. Man, I have to walk a whole 
'nuther block to get my artificial caffeine fix!

I get to the machine that has some cans in stock, and that's when my problems 
begin. I purchase the first can, then immediately purchase the second, without 
removing the first. No big deal, I've done this tons of times in the States. I 
look down, and realize that the second can has jammed the dispensing slot. A 
metal plate has distended, which blocks both cans, and has a message printed on 
it: something about calling the service representatives. My first instinct is to 
panic, because not only have I seemingly lost 240 yen (yeah, the Dew is pricey 
here), but I also don't have my tasty beverages.

Calling upon my natural intuitive powers, I immediately try to force the cans 
out, which doesn't work. I also feel a bit self-concious, because of course 
there are people nearby, watching me try to break this machine. In my struggle, 
however, I notice that I can push one of the cans upwards, back into the 
machine, thereby allowing the metal plate to move back into place. I proceed to 
do this, then collect my just reward.

Who could write so much about using a vending machine? Me, apparently.

By the way, here are some pictures:

* [Traffic outside my apartment](/images/more_japan/traffic.jpg). Yes, it's 
  _always_ this busy.
* [Fall leaves](/images/more_japan/red_leaves.jpg). I took this picture a while 
  ago, but never uploaded it. A few days later, all the leaves on this tree were gone.
* [A shrine-like thing](/images/more_japan/shrine_like_thing.jpg). When people 
  say "shrine", they usually mean a Shinto religious building. I don't know what 
  this is; I need to ask someone.
* [Bonsai trees](/images/more_japan/bonsai.jpg). This is actually really cool. 
  Someone filled the entire front part of their house with bonsai.
* [Closeup of the shrine-like thing](/images/more_japan/shrine_thing_close.jpg). 
  It looks like those figures are 'kitsune', or foxes. 
  [More than you ever wanted to know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune) about 
  the kitsune.
* [Another view of my apartment](/images/more_japan/apt2.jpg). I'm sure you'll 
  never get tired of these.
* [Land for sale](/images/more_japan/state_owned.jpg). The sign says 
  'kokuyuuchi', which means "state-owned land." They want 33,000,000 yen for it, 
  which equates to around 300 grand.
* [An older picture of Sam, Rie, and me](/images/more_japan/sam_rie_me.jpg). I 
  thought it was pretty funny.

I really should space these pictures out, so I can post one every day. But, I won't.

[Overcompensating](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.wigu.com/overcompensating/). 
Real life, viewed through the lens of subjectivity, can be much funnier than 
fiction. This is a comic strip based on that viewpoint. It also doesn't make a 
whole lot of sense, but I found it interesting anyway.
