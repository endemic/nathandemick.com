Why do I have the desire to obtain more junk? Some innate sense that my life will somehow be better once possessing a thing, I guess. Aside from a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro" alt="MacBook Pro">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.asicsamerica.com/onitsukatiger/" alt="Onitsuka Tigers">new shoes</a>, I'm also looking at a <a href="http://video-games.search.ebay.com/sega-cdx_Systems_W0QQcatrefZC12QQcoactionZcompareQQcoentrypageZsearchQQcopagenumZ1QQfromZR10QQfsooZ1QQfsopZ1QQftrtZ1QQftrvZ1QQsacatZ62054QQsaprchiZQQsaprcloZ" alt="CDX">Sega CDX</a>. I actually don't own a Genesis or Sega CD, so I would try to justify this purchase with the excuse that I need both systems, and it's a smaller form factor than buying both separately. But here's where common sense comes into play: I haven't yet finished the game I rented more than a month ago, my preordered copy of Final Fantasy XII comes in tomorrow, and the Nintendo Wii is out later this month. When am I going to have time to play a CDX? The only possible rationale is from a collector's standpoint, but the last thing I need is more stuff. Perhaps if I can get one cheaply enough...
