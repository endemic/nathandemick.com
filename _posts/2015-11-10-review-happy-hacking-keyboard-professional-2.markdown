Recently I took the plunge and purchased a Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2.

### Design

The first thing you notice about the HHKP is its small footprint. It is approximately
the size of a laptop keyboard, but the keys are full size. I purchased the
black version, which uses a dark grey plasic for the board/keys, with black
lettering on the key tops. Taken as a whole, it looks very attractive and minimalistic.
One thing to note is that the contrast between the keys and labels is very
slight, which might make it difficult to see in a darkened room. The textured
plastic also seems to attract lint, which mars the overall appearance.

### Feel

The keys feel great; if you're used to typing on modern Apple keyboards, the
key travel will feel almost excessive at first. I wasn't sure what I would
think about Topre switches, but I think that I like
them; they aren't really noisy, but have a deep, satisfying "thunk" when they
bottom out. The keycaps have a textured plastic on the top which is also very
pleasant to feel. I think that overall, the switches fulfill the requirement
I had for them, which was to provide moderately deep travel and not be too
loud for a cramped office space.

### Compromises

Of course, the reason why the HHKP is so polarizing is that the designers
made some choices that not everyone will agree with. Probably the most obvious
is that there are no dedicated arrow keys; you have to press a modifier key
plus one of the `[`, `;`, `'` or `/` keys. If you're a visual text editor
power user, this may very well be a dealbreaker for you. The only other real
annoyance I've found is the placement of the tilde (~) key, which is on the
upper right side of the board, above the `Delete` key. It's very commonly used
in Unix-flavored systems (e.g. `cd ~` will take you to your home directory), and
I have not gotten used to its placement yet.

### Conclusion

Although it will only appeal to a subset of keyboard enthusiasts, I have
enjoyed using the HHKP. If you use a computer professionally, it's definitely
worth your time to investigate other keyboards besides the one baked into your
laptop.
