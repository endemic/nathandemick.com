    oh, wow.  I think Andy goes to our kinship sometimes.  I haven't really met him fully, but I've been in conversations with him and others.

    Wow, this is a small world - I love it!

<p>Remember that <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/2008/03/25/miyamoto-signed-super-famicom/" title="not-yet-day-old post about the Miyamoto-signed Super Famicom">not-yet-day-old post about the Miyamoto-signed Super Famicom</a>? In a bizzaro twist, it turns out that the seller, one Nathan Smart, is an attendee of the same church as my good buddy <a href="http://andy.teamsoell.com" title="Soulman">Soulman</a>. If I would have actually looked at the seller's location, I might have anticipated this coming. Nathan writes a bit about <a href="http://www.nathansmart.com/blog2/?p=203" title="his motivation behind selling the system">his motivation behind selling the system</a>. I can totally sympathize with his concern &ndash; just having too much stuff to cart around. Some dude in a movie once said, "The stuff you own ends up owning you." However, I can guarantee that such a one-of-a-kind item would make its way to the top of my "stuff to keep" list.</p>
