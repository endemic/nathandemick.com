<p>Due to elements beyond my control, I'm now being forced to work on Saturdays, with Sunday and Monday off. This really wouldn't be such a bad thing (actually, it is a bad thing, because national holidays that fall on a Monday now mean absolutely nothing), except that it totally throws off my internal clock: I know that today is Sunday, but it doesn't FEEL like Sunday. It doesn't feel like anything, actually, but at least I don't have to work, which puts a postive spin on the entire situtation.</p>
<p>I showed Brendan a picture I had taken of him. "My head seems small," he noted.</p>
<p>Links for your viewing pleasure (or displeasure; far be it from me to force you into automatic acceptance of something I find amusing):</p>

<a href="http://keithschofield.com/djformat-video/">This is not the next Bemani game, although it would be cool if it was.</a></p>
<p>Speaking of Bemani, I played Guitar Freaks and Pop'n Music today. Watching crazy Japanese kids absolutely go nuts on these games always makes me think that it's really quite a waste. Here they are learning a skill that is in no way transferrable; it gives no benefit other than itself. When the arcade stops carrying that game, it doesn't matter how good you are, all your efforts are basically thrown away. I still stand by my idea of making music games that use real notation, where at least the kid would learn how to read sheet music, if nothing else.</p>
<p>I also went to an amazing store today, where <a href="http://www.390yen.jp">everything costs 390 yen</a>. This in and of itself is not particularly amazing. The amazing thing is the variety of the store's products. In one box, they had a large stack of old, 50's era full page advertisements. There were piles of American licence plates (kinda cool for Japanese folks). They had actual USED CLOTHING, stuff that I would ACTUALLY BUY, all the same price. I ended up buying one of the old advertisements, because it <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/more_japan/long_distance.jpg">seemed appropriate</a>.</p>
