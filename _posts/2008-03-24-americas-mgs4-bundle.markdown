<p>I was actually looking forward to the release of the <a href="http://kotaku.com/370500/a-better-look-at-mgs4s-steel-ps3" title="'gun metal' PS3">"gun metal" PS3</a>... I probably would have actually bought it, due to the fact that it looks a lot better than the glossy black plastic of the original PS3 chassis. Oh yeah, and it would have come with really the only game I'm interested in playing on the PS3 &ndash; Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots.</p>
<p>Well, my dreams of gun-metal-PS3-owning are dashed &ndash; apparently the US only gets a <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/product.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1&product%5Fid=270209" title="lame, limited edition version of the game itself">lame, limited edition version of the game itself</a>.</p>
<p>I still might get it ('cos I'm a sucker for that sort of stuff... remember the <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/2007/11/13/wheres-my-super-mario-galaxy/" title="dilemma regarding my Mario Galaxy commemorative coin">dilemma regarding my Mario Galaxy commemorative coin</a>?), but I'll be very annoyed while forking over my money to the morbidly obese cashier.</p>
