    Hey Skater

    First time writer, long time reader.  (Well that's not true, 1st time), although I love the picture of that guy eatting Rahmen who might apparently beat the snot out of you(you probably are safe).  Just thought I would say hi, and give you mad rops(did I use that properly?) for finally giving yourself a haircut (hippy).  Yeah J-Denny's suck, they have no right to serve Tempura, that being said they are still better than American Dennys.

<p>Angsty entries are an online journal cliche, so if I go for days at a time without updating, just imagine that I'm writing the word "hate" over and over.</p>
<p>I went to Denny's with Brendan tonight, which was interesting. I wanted pancakes or something, but the menu was entirely Japan-ified. No eggs, bacon, or waffles, but soba and hamburg (not a typo). I ate overpriced lasagna. It had a lot of cheese, though, so that was some small consolation.</p>
<p>I also gave myself a haircut for the first time in four months. It's too short.</p>
