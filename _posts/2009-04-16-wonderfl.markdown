<p>This isn't exactly news, but I <a href="http://wonderfl.kayac.com/user/butr0s" title="created an account">created an account</a> on the Japanese social network/code sharing site <a href="http://wonderfl.kayac.com/" title="Wonderfl">Wonderfl</a>. It's kind of cool... you can use the site to automatically compile Actionscript 3 code, then save it for other people to check out. If you see some code you like, or that sparks a new idea, you can "fork" it &mdash; copy it and save your own version. I was kind of surprised... I added two small demos on Monday, and by Wednesday some other users had already modified my demos. There's a lot of random crap, but you can also learn some cool techniques by browsing through the user-submitted code. If you have any interest in Actionscript, you should check it out.</p>
