<p>Another day, another app store. Here's <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ganbarugames.shikaku.madness" title="Shikaku Madness on Google Play">Shikaku Madness on Google Play</a>. I was able to use my brand new <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7" title="Nexus 7">Nexus 7</a> to test/publish an Android Cordova build of the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Javascript performance of the Android WebView isn't quite as good as the iOS UIWebView; the main user interaction (tap + drag to create rectangles) is faster on my two year-old iPhone 4 than on the Nexus 7. However, CSS transitions perform great on both devices.</p>
<p>I was hoping to integrate a Google Play in-app billing Cordova plugin, so as to make the game available for free (and sell additional puzzles), but the only plugin I could find didn't seem to be very robust, and didn't work for me "out of the box." I considered writing my own plugin, but that in itself is kind of a daunting task, due to the fact that I have no Android/Java experience. Who knows, maybe if I get real bored (or if the Android version doesn't sell any copies) I might try to make a free version.</p>
<p>In any case, if you have an Android device, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ganbarugames.shikaku.madness" title="Shikaku Madness on Google Play">check it out</a>!</p>
