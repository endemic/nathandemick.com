So, I've been on this "I must download everything I can or I will explode" kick and one of the last movies I got just so happened to be Blade: Trinity.<br>
For starters, it was directed by David S. Goyer. I have no idea who this dude is. I guess he's done some stuff (<b>edit:</b> Matt informed me that he and Christopher Nolan wrote the screenplay for Batman Begins. Thanks Matt.) and I guess he's going to be doing the Ghost Rider movie as well. Anyway, the movie itself is pretty much like the last two Blade installments. Blade runs around and kicks people and kills vampires to rap music. Whistler dies <b>AGAIN.</b> Nothing really new or exciting here except for that this time around Blade has to fight Dracula with the help of the Nightstalkers.<br>
It's kind of got a new feel this time as well, some shots with the ULTRA-WHITE SUPER CONTRASTâ„¢ lense filter and some frame rates of 60+ fps make for some crisp, jagged action scenes (which is probably the movies only saving grace).<p>
Ok let's take a look at the cast. First, we have Wesley Snipes in his usual role, Blade. Also, returning again is Kris Kristofferson as Whistler (even though he <b>DIED</b> in the first movie... I'm never going to let that go). <br>
Then we have Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder from Van Wilder) as Hannibal King, a wise cracking Nightstalker. This movie only further proves my theory that someone, somewhere, in Hollywood took some of Jason Lee's DNA and spliced it with Aston Kutcher's DNA to create Ryan Reynolds (supposedly he's from Canada and going to marry Alanis Morissette but I say it's all a LIE. A LIE!). His character in this movie is like if you took Brodie and threw him in some riot gear and told him to go fight Dracula. <br>
Finally we have Jessica Beil as Whistlers daughter... or something. I couldn't hear or really pay attention whenever she came on the screen because all the blood left my head and I would almost pass out every time.<p>
Let's see, who else. Oh yeah, Parker Posey makes a kinda hot <strike>goth chick</strike>vampire. She could be hotter but most of the movie she's walking around with this snarly, mouf-full-o-teef look which isn't very flattering. <br>
Patton Oswalt is in it, he has a line or two and *GASP* they have swears in them. <br>
Finally, we're left with Triple H (Paul Michael Levesque) of WWF or C or E or whatever fame. He plays the role of Large Stupid Vampire which is pretty fitting because his role in life seems to be Large Stupid Man. GOOD JOB TRIPLE H. YOU SUCCEEDED.<p>
That's about it for this review since I can't think of anything else to really say about Blade: Trinity aside from you probably don't want to see this movie.<p>
Upcoming reviews: The Machinist, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, and The Amityville Horror (maybe).
