<p>My apartment was besieged by Japanese Mormons today; these two old ladies who about crapped their pants when I answered the door. In spite of that, they still valiently tried their best, but most Japanese people don't realize that they should <i>speak slowly</i> to people who obviously aren't good at the language (i.e. all foreigners, at least in the Japanese mind). I eventually butchered my way out of the situation.</p>
<p>Yeah, it'll be good to get back to the States. I've come to the conclusion that everything I like about Japan can be enjoyed just as much in America, if not more so.</p>
