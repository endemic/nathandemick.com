I downloaded and used <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> yesterday, and wanted to plug it here. Skype is a Voice over IP (internet telephone) program, which allows you to call other Skype users for free, or dial to landlines/cellphones for a small fee. The real attraction of this product for me is precisely that small fee. I think on average, the cost per minute is somewhere around 1.2 Euro cents (yes, you buy phone credit in Euros). So, after downloading and setting up the program last night (minimal hassle), I bought 10 Euros worth of credit. At the end of the night, having made about an hours worth of calls, my credit stood at 9.10 Euros. Too bad I only have a month left in Japan, otherwise I would make much more use of it. As it stands, though, I imagine that Skype is a valid alternative to most long-distance plans in the States. Check it out!
