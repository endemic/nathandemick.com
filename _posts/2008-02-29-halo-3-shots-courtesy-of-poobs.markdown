<p>This is neet. Apparently you can take screenshots in-game, whereupon they are uploaded to Bungie's website. Poorbaugh has taken <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/Screenshots.aspx?gamertag=lazlo%20soot" title="a few cool shots">a few cool shots</a>, and I am linking them here. Because I can. Not that I actually <em>play</em> Halo at all, but the idea is cool.</p>
