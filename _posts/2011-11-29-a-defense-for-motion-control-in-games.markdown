<p>Last night I read a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/27/2590471/hit-detection-and-other-screen-side-fashion-faux-pas">screed on The Verge forums</a> from a guy who lamented the fact that games have become too accessible. He remembers fondly the time spent as a youth when he played difficult games, and calls out the new Zelda game (<em>Skyward Sword</em>) as example of a "soft, hit-detection-free experience."</p>
<p>Even though I've just started playing the game, I don't feel this way about <em>Skyward Sword</em> at all. In fact, I'm finding it <strong>more</strong> difficult than other Zelda games I've played. There are a few reasons for this: mostly because of the precision motion control required, but also due to other changes, such as a shield that wears down over time, and fewer randomly found hearts. Playing this morning, I actually died to the first dungeon boss. While it could have been that my sleep-deprived mind couldn't recognize patterns effectively, it's also true that I played through <em>Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>Majora's Mask</em> without ever coming close to dying.</p>
<p>Some Wii games certainly do have "floaty" controls, but these are games that have a broad audience (such as Wii Sports). However, most of the other games I've played on the Wii use the remote/nunchuck combo for a more traditional control scheme; perhaps they use the remote for pointing a cursor on the screen as well. While the Wii made broad strokes into a "blue ocean" of non-gamers, it still has a lot to offer to those who were raised on the original NES.</p>
