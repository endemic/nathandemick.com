    yeah. I was thinking about writing a review of it today when I got off work but
    you beat me to it.<br>\r\nAnyway, I loved it. It was badass. Bruce's training
    on the ice with swords. Too cool. I think the only thing I didn't like was the
    new batmobile and how it \"jumped\" to and fro from the batcave to land and vice
    versa.<br>\r\nOther than that, I wish the Scarecrow got a little more screen time.
    Liam Neeson is an awesome Ras Al Gul. Gary Oldman did well too. Michael Cane layed
    it on a bit thick but was a pretty good Alfred.<p>\r\nOverall, I give it 3 A++'s
    out of a 4 A+ system."

Go see Batman Begins. It's hardcore and whatnot. I just got back from watching it with Brendan. We rode our bikes to the local mall/theater complex, and when we were almost there, I accidentally hit a curb with my bike, destroying the front tire (only the tube, not the rim, fortunately). The upshot was that I had to run/walk my bicycle back to the area near my apartment (3 miles away); I left it in front of the closest repair shop, so I can mosey on down there tomorrow morning. <p>
Aside from that, today was pretty good.
