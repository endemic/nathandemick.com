### (Original title: What Went Wrong With Metroid Prime)

Like many people, I've always had a soft spot for Nintendo's Metroid franchise. 
Like all the other old-school gamers out there, I found Super Metroid to be just 
about the pinnacle of the side-scrolling action/adventure genre. I had hoped 
that the newest installment of the Metroid series would be able to capture the 
sense of adventure and general coolness the previous games had come to 
represent. And while Metroid Prime certainly does have its strong points, it 
fails as an overall game.

Let me first point out some of the strong points in Metroid Prime. The levels 
are exquisitely designed. The music is a mix of new and remixed tunes from Super 
Metroid, which is always a good thing. Of course, the graphics engine is top 
notch. The puzzles I played through weren't too inspired, but they were way 
better than any other FPS game; not to mention, Metroid was never a 
puzzle-intensive series. In a word, the game made the transition to 3D 
fairly easily.

My real problem with the game lies in its control system. The problem is that 
Retro Studios didn't use the standard FPS control style with Prime. The existing 
control system is poorly designed. The first problem is that there is no 
"free-look" aspect of the control. Every other FPS on a modern console uses 
(or has the option to use) a "dual-stick" control style. That is, one analogue 
stick controls moving forwards, backwards, strafing left, and strafing right. 
The other stick controls "pitch" (looking up and down) and "yaw" (turning 
left and right). Metroid Prime does not utilize this method of control, 
and it's extremely annoying to play 3D FPS games without it. The overall feel 
of the game is that the player is wearing a neck brace: it's hard to look around 
naturally.

Prime tries to compensate for this lack of control by using a "free-look" button 
and "lock-on" button. Both these solutions fail to compensate for the lack of 
dual-stick control. The free-look button allows the player to adjust the pitch 
of the viewpoint (the player can look around.) The problem with this 
implementation is that to look around, the player has to stand still. This 
promotes annoyance when enemies come at you from outside your field of vision, 
and you have to stop, allow yourself to get shot at, and rotate your view in 
order to see the enemies. The problem of having to stop in order to look around 
also deals with the "lock-on" button. The lock-on button will automatically put 
the nearest enemy directly within your crosshairs, but the player has to be 
looking in the general direction of the enemy. Again, this is a problem when 
enemies come and shoot at you outside your field of view. The player has to 
stop, look around, and then hold the lock-on button in order to shoot.

Another problem that stems from the control is that platform jumping within the 
game is really annoying. By default, platform jumping in 3D games is inherently 
hard to accomplish, especially in a first person viewpoint. This is why most FPS 
games don't rely on jumping as a staple of game play. The reason for the 
difficulty in Prime is because when jumping, the player can't look downwards to 
see what they're leaping from. Not only that, but when jumping to a lower 
platform, the player can't look downwards at what they're leaping to. Apparently 
when jumping downwards, the camera does slightly pan downwards in order for the 
player to glimpse what he is jumping on. However, when I was playing, this only 
happened once or twice, and the change in camera angle was not by a significant 
enough degree.

I seem to be making a huge point against the control system. Many people would 
ask why the control is such a big deal. Well, lack of good control is a glaring 
flaw. In my experience with modern FPS games, a 3D environment is only useful 
as a game world if the player can totally immerse himself within said world. 
Without the ability to view the 3D (realistic) world as a normal human would, 
suspension of disbelief doesn't work (i.e. it becomes too hard for the player 
to put himself in the place of the videogame character). If the control system 
is bad, it's impossible to enjoy the game, because the very act of playing the 
game is frustrating.

Of course, some might argue that I'm simply bad at games, and can't adapt to 
different control styles. I may suck at videogames, but I'm not a masochist or 
a fanboy. Although I have a soft spot in my heart for Nintendo and its 
franchises, I won't be coerced into playing something I dislike simply because 
it wears the Nintendo brand. Obviously, control of the game is enough of an 
issue for me to dislike the game, and therefore I won't play it. 

Others might totally discount my arguments against Metroid Prime, saying that 
control isn't enough of an issue for me to really dislike it. However, I've 
admitted that I enjoy Nintendo games. I seriously liked Super Metroid, and 
admitted to having no qualms about turning the franchise 3D. What reason would 
I have to purposely find trivial areas of the game that I didn't like?

Some rabid fanboys claim that I shouldn't hold Prime to FPS standards, because 
"Prime isn't an FPS." However, whether the fanboys like it or not, all games 
can be grouped into a few broad categories. For instance, at first glance,
 Pikmin seems to defy categorization. But when you think about it, the game has 
 many similarities to RTS games: resource management, time management, army 
 management. The exact same is true about Metroid Prime. Although it's not 
 exactly like, say, DOOM, it has many, many FPS-centric components. Since I 
 expect FPS-like games to play like FPS games, it's a real letdown when they 
 don't.

The expectation of control is a significant factor in designing games. Here, a 
conversation between my sister and me (via instant chat) outlines the 
frustration of changed game control:

> SISTER: I bought an SNES two-pack game today, Tetris and Dr. Mario
> ME: awesome
> SISTER: but whoever designed it made it so that the pieces in both games rotate OPPOSITE of the way they rotate in the NES games
> ME: haha, that's horrible
> SISTER: it is, it pisses me off so much
> SISTER: cuz I rock at the NES versions
> SISTER: but I can hardly beat the SNES games

Unless the player has extreme will-power to persevere in the face of adverse 
control, there is no reason that they would feel compelled to keep playing (and 
yes, she is really good at those games.)

To those of you who would say that no one else agrees with my assessment of 
Metroid Prime's control style, I offer the example of EGM. In their January 2003 
issue, the review of Metroid Prime notes, "The only real complaint is... with 
the controls." (EGM 186) They also note that the control setup "becomes more 
complicated and time consuming [than the standard FPS control style]." (EGM 186) 
EGM still gave the game a perfect score, because they felt the rest of the game 
compensated for the bad control. I disagree, which is my prerogative as a game 
player and reviewer.

In conclusion, I've learned my lesson about buying games before renting them. 
Although we all know not to believe the hype that some new and improved product 
might generate, sometimes it's hard to stay objective. I was able to recoup my 
losses by selling my copy of Metroid Prime on eBay, but next time I might not 
be so lucky.
