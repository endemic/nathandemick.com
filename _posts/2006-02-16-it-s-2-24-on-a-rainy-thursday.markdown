Ok, now it's 2:51, 'cos I've been doing work. Laura says I should update the
page more; to be honest, I should retire this domain and get one based on my
name, there to keep the resum&eacute; and programs and stuff. I just can't
write about personal things on the 'net, which seems to be a requirement of
good online journals. The reason being I don't like to spew emotional gibberish,
to be read and interpreted by all and sundry. For example, yesterday we were
reading a friend's blog, and it was so personal that I almost, _almost_ barfed.
I send email (sometimes) mentioning pertinent details, so if you're not on the
list, I guess you should email me sometime, jerk.

Here's something cool: I just finished playing some games of 9-ball on the pool
table that my company got for doing a stupid website. It's kinda nice to take a
break that way around 3:30 in the afternoon.

I'm going to some kind of men's retreat this weekend; where to, I have no idea.
I don't know what's going to happen there, either. How's that for organized and
informed? Recent developments have made me a bit less enthusiastic about going
than I originally was (think of apathy turning into mild distaste). What recent
developments? Here's where I get to make vague references that those in the know
will smile and nod their heads over. All you other chumps can try to use
Sherlock Holmes-style deduction to figure me out. Just think of what possible
(and rational) reasons I might have for **not** wanting to leave town, on the
weekend especially. If you guess correctly, you win absolutely nothing except a
glowing sense of self-satisfaction.

In other news, I'm thinking of expanding the Linker's links on the main page,
so I can post multiple links and people will actually see them. And, that's all!
