    Mean to tell you, Murikami has a new book out, Kafka On The Shore.  I picked it up when I was in Portland a few weeks back, but haven't cracked it open yet.

    I might get it eventually, but right now I'm not sure I feel in the mood to read
    Murakami.

<p>Today was my first day back at work after my crazy weekend. I did the interview thing in Osaka, and hung out with Sam on Sunday/Monday as well. I beat him in Mario Kart. One of these days I'm going to find enough people to play Mario Kart 64, and destroy them all.</p>
<p>Sam recently bought some pellet guns, the purpose of which is to spread small, plastic balls all over the apartment. They are stupidly fun to shoot, though.</p>
<p>We also made pancakes. Hey, I happen to like pancakes!</p>
<p>There was no real question in the last post.</p>
