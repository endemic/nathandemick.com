    haha, yeah, that Ozaki place is strangely reminicent of Ghetto Grocery

    I'm sure you'll miss working there

    soulman: I wish you would have gotten the shot of me actually clearing that gap. Heh, oh well, it's a hella cool ani-gif anyway.

    I would have gotten the shot, if you had ever actually cleared it.  Like Ed did:

    a feat was possible :P

  content: I dunno dude, he made it pretty easily.  You look like you need to eat
    more Wheaties or somehing.  All these lies about how you "totally cleared it"
    are only hurting you in the long run.  We know the truth, and if you're not careful
    we may start calling you Bill, or maybe Casey.

<p>Picture update:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/more_japan/ozaki.jpg">Ozaki</a>, the supermarket I usually go to. It's kind of a trashy place, but the main benefit is that it stays open past 9PM. Since I usually get off work AFTER 9, going shopping is sometimes problematic.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from my trip to Chicago last year. Probably never uploaded them.<br />
<a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/chicago/ed_kakish.jpg">Ed and Kakish</a> playing Halo or something.<br />
<a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/chicago/soulman.jpg">Soulman</a><br />
<a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/chicago/soulman_ed.jpg">Soulman and Ed ridin' the El</a><br />
<a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/chicago/ed_strikes_a_pose.jpg">Ed poses on the El platform</a></p>
<p>The next pictures are from the <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/chicago/modern_art.jpg">Millennium Park</a> in Chicago. There were some neet-looking sculptures and whatnot there. The coolest piece was probably <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/chicago/the_bean.jpg">The Bean</a>. <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/chicago/the_bean2.jpg">Another shot of The Bean</a>. Unfortunately, the park hadn't officially opened yet, so there was still a fence keeping us away from the wonder of The Bean. I love capitalizing The Bean.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT QUESTION, FEEDBACK NEEDED<br />
So, I have an idea for a multiplayer PHP game (like I've said many, many times). But, I'm not even going to try programming it unless I can get people to actually try it out. I had hoped for people like Matt and Tyler to maybe try playing it, but there's no way I can compete with World of Warcraft :P</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/docs/game_design.txt">Rough Idea</a></p>
<p>If you think you might like to muck around with this program, let me know in the comments; I'll continue working on it if there's enough interest.</p>
<p>EDIT: I was checking out the traffic info for this page (which I do sometimes, out of a desire for useless knowledge), looking at referrals. Most referrals come from from search engine image searches, but a few are different. So, I found <a href="http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/~02fb087/">Rie's Homepage</a>! She links me! Woo! You gots to read the Japanese, though :P</p>
