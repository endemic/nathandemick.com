Usually people in Japan tend to have smaller pets, for obvious reasons. However, 
last night I saw a large dog tied up in front of a 7-11. It looked pretty cool, 
so [I took a picture](http://www.bitter-gamer.com/images/more_japan/doggie.jpg).
The owner was laughing at the crazy gaijin taking pictures of a dog.

Tangent: the 7-11 chain of convenience stores exist in Japan, but the store name 
is written in "Japanized" English: Seben-Ereben. However, I think the name 
would translate well directly into Japanese: Shichi-Juichi. Of course, the 
store would lose a bit of the chain image if that happened. Globalization! 
Yes! Hey! I'm not bitter about it!
