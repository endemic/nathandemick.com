<p>So, I'm finally going to post a link to the <a href="http://www.bitter-gamer.com/rsp/">re-designed verson of rock/scissors/paper</a>. The one major change is that you can challenge people multiple times without them having to respond. This should make the game a bit more interesting. Post suggestions/ideas/etc in the comments.</p>
