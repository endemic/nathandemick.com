    the side al la that one loser from blink 182 we can't be friends anymore.

    advise against this.  :)"

  content: 'No, it would be centered. I want to do it for the experience of having
    something pierced; I guess if it looks bad, I can just let it heal. '

  content: "see dude, just get a tat.\r\nimo, tats are more of an artform than getting
    a hole poked somewhere in your body.\r\nhowever, i can see why getting a piercing
    would be more appealing than getting a tat because if you dont like the piercing
    than you can just take it out and let it heal, however if you dont like the tat,
    well, you're kind of stuck with it until you either get that laser surgery or
    just cut it off (which a real man would do)."

  content: I dunno, I can't think of any tatoo I would want. And yeah, it's permanent.
    Your  comment about blink 182 made me think of this story where some kid got their
    signatures inked into his skin. He'll probably regret that later. Also, my skin
    is too nasty for a tatoo anyway; I still get acne on my back and upper arms. I
    can just imagine a zit leaving scars in the middle of a tatoo. Nasty, I know,
    but the sad truth.

  content: "What is this talk of tats?!?!?!  NO.  I got my bellybutton pierced five
    years ago and that was a stupid thing to do because every random skank has her
    bellybutton pierced, and I'd rather not ally myself with the likes of random skanks.
    \ My only consolation is that it cost me like $10 and I don't wear belly shirts
    anyway so people rarely see it.  In fact I've been meaning to take it out for
    a long time now but I'm just a lazy bum and it's kind of complicated (I'd have
    to bust out the pliars and whatnot).  <br><br>\r\nANYWAY.  My point is that piercings
    and tattoos are transitory and stupid and they quickly lose their appeal.  Besides,
    they're NOT CLASSY.  If you really want to set yourself apart start wearing classy
    clothes.  Chicks dig classy clothes."

  content: "well, i only offered the tattoo option in case nate was hard up to do
    some sort of body modification.<br>\r\nim planning on getting a tattoo at some
    point, nothing fancy, probably a band (no, not like a group of musicians).<br>\r\nhowever,
    if i had the money and the pain tolerance i'd get a full body tat like a yakuza
    :)"

I'm getting a lip ring like <a href="http://shenandoradewynst.com/images/prince2005.jpg">Nigel Bennett</a>, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop me!<p>
EDIT: There's nothing that can stop me except for massive negative feedback!
