<p><a href='http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=1092615' title='Friday, June 29th Run'><img src='http://www.bitter-gamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/06-29-07.thumbnail.png' alt='Friday, June 29th Run' style='float: right; margin-left: 5px' /></a></p>
<p>So the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" title="iPhone">iPhone</a> comes out today. Woop-de-whoop! For a while, I was thinking about getting one, but then I realized that you pay $60/month minimum for service, on top of a $500 phone. Plus I'd have to cancel my contract with T-Mobile, which they would rob me for. When I think of other irresponsible things I could do with that money, a few other options spring to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a <a href="http://www.surlybikes.com/steamroller_comp.html" title="New Bike">new bike</a></li>
<li>Buy a <a href="http://us.wii.com/" title="Nintendo Wii">Nintendo Wii</a></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a></li>
<li>Save it in my bank account so I don't die in the gutter</li>
</ol>
