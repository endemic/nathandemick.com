  content: i saw that survey offer a long time ago.  will that stylus actually fit
    into the DS?  it looked like it had a non-standard shape.

<p>In the never-ending quest to get more <em>junk to put in my house</em>, I filled out a <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/hourglass" title="Nintendo survey">Nintendo survey</a> about The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass, and will now receive a limited edition DS stylus. Yes, I am a slave to marketing-type people. Hey, as long as I get free video game-related stuff, I'll do whatever.</p>
