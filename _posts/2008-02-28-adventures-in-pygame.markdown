<p>So, I was getting frustrated with attempting to program in C/C++; I just didn't have the motivation to finish projects, and wanted to remove obstacles to completion (in this case, the complexity of mixing a graphics API with a game API in a compiled language that I don't use much anymore). I decided to try out <a href="http://www.pygame.org" title="PyGame">PyGame</a>, and so far am fairly impressed. I'm leaving out the OpenGL side of things, and going with just straight pixel blitting, but so far doing simple stuff like loading an image (pygame.image.load()) and writing text (font.render()) is way easier than it's SDL/OpenGL counterpart. To be fair, this may just be complexity with OpenGL, but I also like Python's syntax more than C++. I mostly use PHP at work, so I'm way more familiar these days with interpreted languages. If you want to follow along at home, <a href="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml" title="download a Python interpreter and PyGame">download a Python interpreter and PyGame</a>. Heck, there's even a PyOpenGL wrapper, so if I want I can get back into the three-dee.</p>
