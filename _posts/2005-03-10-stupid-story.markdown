No pictures today, but I thought I'd regale you all with (what I consider) kind 
of a humorous story.

When I first got to Japan, I started teaching the next day. Of course, I'm a bit 
nervous, but trying to act cool about it. When I go into the office, I get 
introduced as the new teacher, of course. In Japanese, "kore wa atarashi sensei 
desu." Then the (all female) staff members start saying "kawaisou desune?" I 
recognize "kawaii," which means "cute," and am thinking I've already made a big 
hit in the ol' office. Now, here comes the grammar: usually the "~sou desu" 
ending means "looks like/seems like~" (e.g. "muzukashisou" is "seems difficult," 
"oishisou" is "looks delicious"). Bearing this in mind, you would THINK 
"kawaisou" means "cute looking," and if you thought that, you would be wrong. 
It actually means "pitiful" or "pathetic."

In reality, everyone was trying to sympathize with the fact that I had to teach 
with no training. Ha ha ha, I felt pretty dumb.
