I was just about to leave, when I remembered that I wanted to revert to my old page code on b-g.com, the one where people could actually write comments. However, I've got blog posts spread out in about 3 different database tables, and consolidating that seemed a bit too much for a Friday afternoon. Not that I've been <em>working</em> or anything, but it's time for me to leave and go play Shadow of the Colossus. Things've been slow the past week, so to occupy myself I've been continuing my dabbling in OpenGL. <a href="/files/movement_demo.zip">This is the proposed control scheme</a> for the game I'm half-assedly working on (space=move; esc=quit). One thing that I've come to realize from all this is that I've forgotten ALL the trig I ever learned in high school. Who knows if this will ever become anything of worth? Not me, that's for sure.
