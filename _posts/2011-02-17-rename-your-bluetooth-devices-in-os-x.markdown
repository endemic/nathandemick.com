<p>Stupid OS X trick today. Know how you can view the connection status of your Bluetooth keyboard/mouse by clicking the icon in your menu bar? Well, normally those are named something boring. Here's how you can assign clever names to your mouse and keyboard. </p>
<p>Open your System Preferences and click the Bluetooth icon. You should see a list of all connected devices. Select one and click the "settings" gear icon at the bottom of the list, then choose the Rename option. That's it! Now you can easily identify which wireless accessories are connected to your computer.</p>
