Got me first bloody nose of the year this morning as I was jogging. Tried to stem the flow with leaves, bracken, and other debris; partially successful, but ended up with blood all over my face. 
<p>As I was walking back to my house, my roommate Jake was coming out to his car. I expected some remark about the blood, but he only mentioned the extreme cold. I don't think he actually looked at me.
<p>No blood last year, due to the somewhat more humid environment of Japan. Gotta remember to bust out the humidifier each night.
