<p>Sooo, I've been trying my hand at music makin' recently, in an effort to make my iPhone game a bit more fleshed out. Fortunately, Macs come with GarageBand, which is (seems to be) a pretty powerful music program. The downside is that 1.) I don't know anything about composition and 2.) I don't know how to use sequencing programs. Put those together and you've got yourself a nice frustrating time. However, I'd like to think that what I lack in talent I make up for in irrational perseverance, so there may be some hope yet.</p>
<p>While messing around, I made <a href='http://nathandemick.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/totakas-song.mp3' title="my own version of Totaka's Song">my own version of Totaka's Song</a>, and am putting it online so that you can listen and say to yourself, "Yep, that's Totaka's Song alright." If you've played Nintendo games with any frequency in your life, you've probably heard this ditty... check out this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLMAgcGA8Dw" title="excellent YouTube series">excellent YouTube series</a>Totaka's Song for all the dirt.</p>
