I seem to continually have dalliances with the Android world. Last year I bought
(then sold) a Sony Xperia Z3, then later purchased/returned an LG Nexus 5X.
I always seem to end up going back to my trusty iPhone 5, though. There are
just enough dealbreakers with any Android phone that make them tough to live with
as a daily driver.

Earlier this spring, I was revamping a few of my iOS apps, and figured that
since they're written using JavaScript and published as "apps" in a Cordova
wrapper, I might as well try publishing on Google Play as well. I'd returned my
Nexus 5X long ago, so started trolling [Swappa](https://swappa.com) for a used
Android phone. I'd had my eye on the Xperia Z3 compact for a while: its stylish
design, coupled with a large screen inside a small(-ish) chassis had me itching
to try one out. I grabbed one for a decent price, released [my apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ganbaru+Games)
to absolutely zero downloads, and then tried using it as my main phone for a bit.

The thing that I love the best about the Z3 Compact is its screen-to-body ratio.
The whole device is just slightly larger than my iPhone 5, but the screen is
about 33% larger. Watching videos and reading books is much more enjoyable.
Plus, since the overall phone size is manageable, you can use it without
resorting to the "smartphone claw grip of death." The body of the phone looks
pretty classy as well -- I got the black version, which is like the prototypical
black slab that all other smartphones descend from. Unfortunately, Sony never
evolved its industrial design past the iPhone 4 era: the phone is all glass,
save for the plastic sides. I always treated it fairly gingerly, as I was never
sure how hard I could set it down without cracking the back.

Unfortunately, the software front is where most Android phones fall down for me.
While most of Google's software is on point (Chrome, Gmail), the Android
messaging scene is pretty fragmented. What I want is a Google-endorsed
messenger that piggybacks on top of SMS, similar to Apple's iMessage. The
app that _might_ have fit that category (Hangouts) is deprecated, and users
are advised to use a standalone SMS app. Rather than double down on Hangouts,
Google instead is promoting two new messengers, Allo and Duo, that you'll have
to get all your friends to download in order for them to be useful at all. Blah.
At that point I'd rather use Facebook Messenger, which at least most people
have installed.

Sony also tries to include a lot of "value-added" software, which is mostly
worthless. They have all sorts of extra media apps, but without a compelling
syncing solution for my Mac, I didn't load any music or videos onto the phone's
internal storage. A few bloatware-type apps (AR Fun, wtf) were immediately
disabled (can't delete these apps, of course). I could sign up for a "My
Xperia" accout, but it's not immediately apparent what benefit it would give me,
aside from yet another set of account details to remember (cursory internet
research tells me it's similar to Apple's Find My iPhone).

Dispite these annoyances, the phone was a pleasure to use, once I disabled/
uninstalled offending Sony software. Since I mostly rely on very basic
smartphone apps (Maps, Email, Browser, Books), I don't mind missing out
on the hottest new iOS microtransaction bandit, errrr, game.

However, I ended up getting rid of the phone. Since my wife
has an iPhone, the lack of iMessage is a real killer. She'd try to send me a
video of the kids, and it would be sent as a hyper-compressed MMS. Static
images would fare no better. Rather a minor thing, but messaging is the
core of my smartphone use.

The other unfortunate thing is that the Z3 Compact has no upgrade path. It
shipped with Android 4.4, and has been (slowly) upgraded through Android 6,
but it's anyone's guess how much longer it will receive updates. While my
iPhone 5 is nearing the end of its update life (4 years!), I know that I can
buy a new phone with updated internals in the exact same form factor, and
have it be supported for another 3+ years. The Z3 Compact has no obvious
successor. Sony released the Z5 Compact last year, but it uses the problematic
Snapdragon 810 processor, and the US version has its fingerprint sensor
disabled(!). The Z5 Compact's design is also a bit more stodgy. And the
Z5 series is the last of the Z's -- Sony's recent crop of X-series phones
are about as forgettable as they come. I don't want to get too attached to
a dying phone.

I guess I'll appreciate the Z3 Compact for what it was at the time, and
hope that one day Apple will release an iPhone 5-sized device with an iPhone
6-sized screen.
