<p>Here's my stupid Super Mario Galaxy story:</p>
<p>The reason I actually went to the trouble of pro-actively scoring a Wii (as opposed to waiting until I could buy one at someplace like Target) was because of Super Mario Galaxy. Super Mario Sunshine suuucked, but I liked Super Mario 64 so much that I was yet again willing to blow a ton of cash to recapture that awesome feeling of when I first played 64 at a kiosk in Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>A digression: back in 1996, I was a total Playstation convert, and had no interest in a Nintendo 64. Mario 64 freaking blew me away. You cannot imagine how amazing that game looked in my 15 year-old mind. After I played at that kiosk, I realized that I had to have a 64, if only for that one game. In this sense, it's history repeating as I bought a Wii to play Galaxy (although I haven't actually tried the game yet, in this case).</p>
<p>I didn't pre-order the game, simply because there are no game stores that are really convenient for me to go to. But I did want the stupid pre-order bonus: a Mario-embossed coin. I would have ordered from someplace on the 'net, but I also didn't want to pay for shipping (are you sensing a theme here? I am one picky bastard). In the end, laziness and cheapness win: I don't pre-order, and decide to just go buy the game on Monday when it is released.</p>
<p>So, yesterday after work I go to the Gamestop near the OSU campus. Imagine my annoyance when the morbidly obese, indifferent employee tells me that "it's not released yet." Yes, yes, it <em>is</em> released, you cretin, you just don't have any copies due to distribution differences. He then advises me that I "better pre-order" the game, and since I'm there already, I put down money for the darn thing.</p>
<p>So embittering... the thought of playing that game was the only thing getting me through work yesterday. And I'm not going to have time to play today until after 10PM at the earliest. Ugh!</p>
