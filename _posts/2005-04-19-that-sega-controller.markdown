Remember that Saturn-style USB pad I bought? Yeah, the main purpose was for 
playing emulators. I've always been a stickler for playing games using the 
original hardware, but using a console controller with a PC comes close enough, 
especially when my game collection is 6000 miles away. Currently going through 
Earthbound; that game never gets old.

After playing with it for a while, though, I have a few comments to make about 
that Sega controller: it's not good for playing Super Nintendo games. Of course, 
Genesis, Nintendo, and Game Boy Advance games are no problem. But the Sega-
specific structure of the buttons (three large on the bottom row, three small 
on the top) makes it difficult to play SNES games that require four buttons in 
a diamond pattern (the familiar BY/AX set). In addition, the shoulder buttons 
seem really flimsy; they almost feel like mouse buttons. The directional pad is 
also hyper-sensitive to diagonal direction inputs.

It probably seems like I hate the darn thing, but in reality I'm glad I bought 
it. It seems pretty difficult to find a regular, non-analog game controller 
these days, and this controller at least fits well in my hands. The other 
option is to buy a console controller->USB adapter. This would probably would 
be the best way to play emulators, if you have access to the controllers you 
want (I don't).

I also bought the full version of Gish, and the controller makes playing it 
quite a bit more fun. I recommend you!
