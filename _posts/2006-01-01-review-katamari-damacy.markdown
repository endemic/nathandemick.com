What would you do if your father, the King of All Cosmos, went on a drunken rampage and knocked all the stars out of the sky? Good question, eh? The solution, obviously, is to roll a sticky ball around the earth. When enough stuff sticks to the ball, you can use it as a star, right? Right. And, as we all know, the earth is full of stuff just waiting to be rolled up. 
<p>
The PS2 title Katamari Damacy uses this lighthearted story as the premise for hours of rolling fun. In teh Japanese, <i>katamari damashii</i> means something like "soul of the clod." Playing as the Prince, your job is to roll your <i>katamari damashii</i> around, picking up more and more objects as you go. Think of it as making a huge snowball, except instead of snow, you use everyday objects, people, and buildings. 
<p>
Controlling your <i>katamari</i> is natural and intuitive. For all intents and purposes, the only method of control is using the two analog sticks on the Playstation controller. The player can think of each stick as representing one arm. Push forward on the right stick, and the <i>katamari</i> moves left, just as if you'd given a large ball a hard shove on the right side in real life. The same applies for the left stick; used in tandem, they offer total control.

<p>
The goal of the main section of Katamari Damacy is to gather as much junk as you can on to your <i>katamari</i>, all while under the pressure of a time limit. Each level is riddled with random junk to pick up. The more you pick up, the bigger your <i>katamari</i> becomes, which in turn means you can pick up bigger items. At the beginning of the game, you pick up tacks, erasers and coins. Towards the end, you pick up cars, office buildings, and then the land masses those buildings recently resided on. 
<p>
The other stages of the game involve certain specific tasks, the goal of which is to create constellations. For example, in order to create a swan constellation, you must roll up as many birds as you can in a certain time limit. Other constellations are created by carefully avoiding certain animals: the King of All Cosmos hates bears, for example, so creating a bear constellation involves only picking up one <i>kuso kuma</i>. 
<p>
Katamari Damacy also includes a two player mode, which involves you and a friend racing around an arena, trying to pick up as many items as you can. You can even pick up the opposing player's <i>katamari</i>, if yours is big enough. 
<p>
A number of things impressed me about Katamari. One of these is the scalability of the game. The transition from picking up paper clips to rolls of toilet paper to cats to buildings is seamless. Everything just keeps getting bigger, and there are no obvious transition points from one section of the game to another. The other thing that was particularly interesting to me is that the game has a lot of Japanese culture embedded within. Many of the items in the game would have no meaning for a western player: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takoyaki>takoyaki</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneki_Neko>maneki neko</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daruma>daruma</a>, and much more. I feel rather lucky to be actually able to appreciate the inclusion of these items. Of course, it doesn't impede your ability to enjoy the game if you don't know what any of these things are, but adds a bit if you do. 

<p>
The soundtrack is another one of the high points of the game. The introductory theme provides the exact level of quirkiness you might expect from such an offbeat game, and the rest of the tracks compliment the game action nicely. A well-made soundtrack that adds to the play experience is something of a rarity, and this is a soundtrack that I'm sure many would consider purchasing on CD. 
<p>
In conclusion, I recommend Katamari Damacy to everyone. The reason I can do so is the simplicity of the game: casual gamers can appreciate the action, and the          will strive to beat their best scores again and again. These days, when milking franchises is the norm, it's refreshing to see a game that uses truly new and innovative ideas and gameplay.
