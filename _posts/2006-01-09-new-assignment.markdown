OK, in light of the <i>insane</i> party which went on at my new house on Saturday, I have a new assignment for you, Poorbaugh: create a playlist/mix of mid-90's era electronic music, suitable for strobe light-driven dancing. I will review the submission, and, by Jove, we won't have as much useless rap at the next 'event.'
