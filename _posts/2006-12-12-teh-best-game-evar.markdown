I was musing today on a "100 Best Games" list published by EGM a couple years ago. The surprising thing at the time (or maybe it wasn't so surprising) was that it <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030611191341/http%3A//gamers.com/feature/egmtop100/index.jsp">ranked Super Metroid as #1</a>.
<br /><br />
Here's an article about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_video_games_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever">highly-rated videogames</a> from Wikipedia. 
<br /><br />
Sadly, I haven't even played a number of games on that first list. I don't particularly like, for example, sports games, so I'd probably never play any of those. There are also a smattering of games from Sega consoles (which I never owned as a child) and even more obscure ones (TurboGrafix-16) which, while compelling in their time, are probably not going to interest me now. It might be interesting, however, to go down the list and check out the games I haven't played. They're on a Top-100 list, so they must be at least decent, right?
