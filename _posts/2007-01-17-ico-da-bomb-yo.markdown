I think Tim Rogers has a pretty succinct description of the game:
<div class="code" style="background: #eff3fd">
...a boy with horns is locked in a sarcophagus in an ancient castle. His captors disappear. The boy somehow escapes. He finds a pale girl, dressed in white, locked in a hanging cage, and he saves her. Black shadows rise from the ground. They want the girl. You beat them off with a stick. The girl reveals she can open doors with her magic palm. One such door leads toward what is apparently the exit of the castle. You're motivated: go.
