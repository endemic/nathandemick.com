Apparently, I can still use the return portion of my original ticket to Japan. This means that instead of paying $1500 for another ticket, I get to go home for FREE. That $1000+ bonus that I thought was going towards another ticket? DIRECTLY INTO MY POCKET. <p>
On a side note, remember when I said I was going to make t-shirt designs? Yeah, it was pretty much a lie, but yesterday I did actually make an image that I will put on a shirt someday. <a href="/images/random/tako_jigoku.png">Check it</a>. It says 'tako jigoku', which means 'octopus hell.' It will totally not make sense to anyone who can read it. <p>
Also, for some strange reason I want to play that Diablo 2 game again. Remember the Paladin character who has those elemental auras? Apparently you can get items which boost Holy Fire/Shock to around level 30 each, then run around wasting people. Alternately, you could make a paladin that has like level 60 Holy Shock. Guhh, stupid time-wasting games! I can't stop thinking about you!
