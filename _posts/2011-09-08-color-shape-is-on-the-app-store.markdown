<p><a href="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/color-shape.png"><img src="http://ganbarugames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/color-shape.png" alt="" title="color + shape app icon" width="180" height="180" class="alignright size-full wp-image-406" /></a>Check-a check it! My new game just got published today. If you have a dollar burning a hole in your pocket, you should <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/color-shape/id446369157?mt=8" title="color + shape on the App Store">download it from iTunes</a>.</p>
<p>There were a few design changes made from when I first announced the game on this blog back in June. For example, instead of having a countdown timer to limit each play session, there's a "move" meter. Each time you move a row or column, the meter decreases. Making matches recharges it. I made this change after seeing my wife successfully play the game by swiping randomly over the iPad. Since the matches come so easily, there needed to be a way to limit the player's moves. Partially because of this change, there's no "Time Attack" mode in the game, since there's no longer a timer. Although it's something that could be added in an update.</p>
<p>In any case, it's a fun little diversion, and I'd like to hear any feedback you might have. I'll be writing a more detailed postmortem about the development process later, so stay tuned!</p>
