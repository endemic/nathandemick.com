<p>I own the GBA cartridge, you cretins, so I hold the moral high ground here. =] It was just getting too frustrating having to constantly refer to a translated script... you really miss a lot of the game, which is a shame when the most interesting thing about the Earthbound/Mother series is the writing.</p>
