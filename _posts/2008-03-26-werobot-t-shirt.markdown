<p>Technically not game-related, but just an awesome t-shirt (there is a rather famous gaming character in there, though). <a href="http://www.chopshopstore.com/product.php?productid=16186" title="Buy it">Buy it.</a></p>
<p>People have been linking up <a href="http://meatbun.us/catalog/" title="Meat Bun">Meat Bun</a>, but I'm not feeling it... their stuff isn't nearly as cool as the <a href="http://www.panic.com/goods/" title="official Katamari Damacy t-shirts from Panic">official Katamari Damacy t-shirts from Panic</a>.</p>
<p>What about the ethical implications of using other companies' intellectual property? Are royalties paid to Sony Computer Entertainment each time a Wanderer/Agro t-shirt is sold? I'm thinking about emailing Meat Bun to find out.</p>
