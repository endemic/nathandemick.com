<p>Just an FYI, for all the businesses out there that are now trying to get on the "social media" bandwagon: spamming people on to your follow list is going to get you blocked. At least by me. </p>
<p>I got followed by some car repair place this morning. Obviously a new account, they had one tweet and were following 800 people. What value are you going to bring to me again? Oh, that's right, none. At least send a mention saying something about your services... it might make me think that you care enough to at least spend 5 seconds thinking about each person you want to have follow you.</p>
