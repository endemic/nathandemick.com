Obviously, there's been a bit of a redesign. Nothing spectacular, but a bit cleaner, with more contrast. I'll be removing people's accounts unless a strict 'game-related-only' rule when posting is adhered to. When I get time and/or motivation, I'll be moving the Linker and blog to my <a href="http://www.nathandemick.com">other domain</a>.

The last game I finished was Shadow of the Colossus, which, in contrast to my design skills, <em>was</em> spectacular. A writeup will come shortly. It impressed me so much that I went out and bought Ico, the previous game the same developer had worked on. No time to play it yet, but I'm hoping this weekend will show some gaming action. In my quest to accumulate more games that I can't play, I also bought two GBA games this morning: the Mother 1+2 compilation, <em>and</em> <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/a3uj/index.html">Mother 3</a> (<a href="http://starmen.net/mother3/mother3world/">Mother 3</a> was only recently released; both games are unavailable in America). This'll hopefully give me some incentive to bust out the (rusty) Japanese skills. Perhaps I'll do some FAQ or translation action.
