the first iteration is complete. if anyone has a mac, you can check it out: <a href="./files/radio.shatterbloom.wdgt.zip">radio.shatterbloom widget</a><p>
I'm not sure if I'm satisfied with it or not. It does what I want it to do, and looks pretty enough.... blahfdskhh<p>
EDIT: it has come to my attention that the zip file isn't working. whatever, I can't use ftp to put the widget because it's technically a folder, but OSX treats it like a file, so I zipped it with the default utility, which somehow doesn't work. I hate computers. Email me and I'll send you the widget.
