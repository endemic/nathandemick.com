  content: dude what did you think of that sufjan stevens album?
- author: Nate
  content: It wasn't too bad. I only listened to it once, and I was working at the
    same time, so I don't remember much. However, it didn't seem dischordant, which
    says a lot nowadays. Like those 'Clap Your Hands Say Yeah' people... that guy's
    voice is the equivalent of fingernails on a blackboard.

To do anything. ANYTHING. I don't even use my laptop anymore. I'd thought about redesigning the webpage, but that's like the biggest joke ever. Write about Mario Kart? No way. I'm moving on Saturday, I think. <p>Ughh, tired, and need sleep. I've been like half-sick for the past week, and it seems to be getting worse. Life=grand!
