<p>Makin' another game! It's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram" title="Nonograms">nonogram</a> game, inspired by Mario's Picross (read more details about the whole genre at <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/12/column_beyond_tetrismarios_pic.php">Game Set Watch</a>).</p>
<p>Admittedly, nonograms aren't for everyone. I enjoy them, however, because they're simple logic puzzles that have a visual component... they're more interesting to me than the straight-up numbers of sudoku. When I explained the concept to Chandra, she seemed interested! It's my goal to make something that she'll play through =]</p>
