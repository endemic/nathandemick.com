The reality-distortion field around Steve Jobs is amazing. I don't even watch TV, yet I'm like "ZOMG MUST BUY" when I see the little Apple TV streaming device. Don't even start on the phone... I'd totally get one, except for the fact that I'd probably have to pay $60+/month for service. My $40/month is too much as it is. <br /><br />

Supposedly, people in the audience crapped themselves simultaneously when Jobs demoed some of the phone's features. You have to admit, Apple hater or not, it's a sweet-looking device.
