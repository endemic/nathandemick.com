  content: That's cool.  I have all the letter keys memorized but I don't think I
    know the numbers and special symbols (aside from common ones).  You should take
    a typing test now and then take one again in a few months to see if you've actually
    improved.  BTW the fan you ordered arrived but I haven't put it in yet.

So, I ordered one of those <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/">keyboards</a> today. I currently have a worthless, <i>worthless</i> Dell keyboard. I'm kind of excited; supposedly even expert typists look at keymarkings a lot, so removing them forces you to memorize the layout of the keyboard. I usually don't look, but some keys (like the numbers/symbols) I can't hit correctly on the first try. Plus, the keys are weighted based on usage frequency and position. Hott!<br /><br />
I'm contemplating writing reviews of videogames this weekend, pending free time. <br /><br />
I'm also contemplating selling my Nintendo DS in anticipation of the DS Lite.

Too much contemplation!<br /><br />
