<p>I was looking around for a free/inexpensive sprite editor the other day, and came across <a href="http://www.humanbalance.net/gale/us/" title="GraphicsGale">GraphicsGale</a>. It has both free and shareware versions, and the free one is definitely nice enough for beginners (such as myself). Funnily enough, the features that I appreciate the most are the ones found in the Mario Paint "stamp" editor: a small preview window and a pixel grid.</p>
