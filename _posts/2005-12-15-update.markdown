I bought a Nintendo DS last night; the new red one bundled with Mario Kart DS. In the limited time I've played it, I think I've already become addicted. The last game I really wanted to play this badly was, I think, the Warcraft III beta. I'll write some stuff about it later, and to tide you over, I give you my current work background: <a href="/images/random/ronald.jpg">ronald.jpg</a>. This was given me by <a href="http://www.nativespeakerguy.com">Brendan</a>; apparently he took a  photo of this crazy display at a Japanese McDonalds.
