<p>Totally not going in to the office tomorrow. Whut whut!</p>
<p>I got my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Nikyo_omote.jpeg" title="Hakama">hakama</a> in the mail yesterday. I was kinda feeling "meh" about aikido for a while, but looking at these "pants" (as Matt, and subsequently Chandra, would say) made me a bit excited. As an aside, the dude wearing the hakama in the picture is rocking the other dude with the "<a href="http://www.ai-ki-do.org/DanPapers/Yondan_GTeekell/Yondan_GTeekell.html" title="Aikido techniques">nikkyo</a>" technique.</p>
