  content: Happy Birthday! That's some ingenuity right there, I must say. I never
    noticed that there weren't stoves in Japanese homes until you mentioned it. Now
    I'm going to burn my host family's house down the next time I'm there. ;_;

Hmm, if I recall correctly, last year on my birthday I constructed home-made PS2 joysticks, and then delivered pizza. The mad excitement. This year probably trumps it: spent pretty much all day teaching. However, I did get a great present, albeit inadvertantly. The horrible 1.5 hour conversation class from 7:30-9:00 on Wednesdays was cancelled by default, because no one came. Which meant that I sat around listening to the iPod and reading Love Hina. I also got to take an earlier train, because my Japanese co-worker did something unprecedented and clocked out for me. So, I totally saved another half-hour in coming home. 
<p>
Last night I attempted to foil Japan's plot to deny me cake (and succeeded). My mom sent me some cake mix, but unfortunately people don't commonly have ovens in this backwards country! There's not even space for an oven in my apartment. In any case, I made do by using my toaster oven and rice cooker (no joke). Take that, Japan! <a href="./images/random/cake/">Check the foto-gallery</a> (totally a directory listing, because I'm lazy! Hey, I resized the images, that should be enough for you!)
