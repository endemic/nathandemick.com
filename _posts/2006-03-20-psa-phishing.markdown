So, more and more I see '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a>' attempts come into my inbox. I'm not too worried that I'll succumb to one of these fraudulent attempts; however, I think that those less 'net-savvy should be aware. I just got a message in my inbox that I will proceed to deconstruct.
<br /><br />
<a href="/images/random/phishing/1.gif">The email</a> — A few things here arouse suspicion. For starters, the subject line uses poor grammar. Next, the 'To:' field doesn't have my specific email address; this indicates the message was sent to many people. Oh, and here was another indicator in my situation: I don't have a Chase bank account.
<br /><br />
<a href="/images/random/phishing/2.gif">The link</a> — The next bit that was suspicious was the address the link led to. It's not www.chase.com, but rather some mangled address. http://ityt.net/~hong, eh? I don't think so.
<br /><br />
<a href="/images/random/phishing/3.gif">The page</a> — Here's the page I am led to. The 'survey' is asinine. Would you pay a customer $20 to fill this out?
<br /><br />
<a href="/images/random/phishing/4.gif">The account information</a> — Phishing attempts will always try to get account details. Beware of entering any sensitive information into a page you got to by clicking an emailed link. Double-check the website address, and when in doubt, <em>don't give out any info</em>. In this case, I filled out their form with some expletives, just because I'm such a nice guy. If <em>you're</em> a nice guy, forward the phishing attempt to the fraud division of the company that the phishers are trying to impersonate.
